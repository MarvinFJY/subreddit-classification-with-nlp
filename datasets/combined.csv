0,"My New Years resolution is to make better coffee. Please give me some advice as to what I should be focussing on first. I’m sick of doing a resolution for a few weeks, stopping then feeling guilty; so this one is designed to snowball into something more permanent. 

I have an aeropress, a V60 and a cafetière. I hardly use the v60 but I did today and got a great cup out of it. 

I’m quite sloppy with my coffee making. I have never tended to measure how much ground coffee I add (just pour some in byeye) and I don’t usually time my brew. My partner does, however, she times her brew and measures the coffee. Guess what?! She makes much better coffee than me. 

I usually buy Lavazza, but I would buy nicer coffee if I was going to put a bit more effort into making it correctly. 

Today I put 12g of Nicaraguan Jinotega into the v60 and poured over hot water (not boiling). I had frothed whole milk in the cup already. It was a great cup of coffee. I’ve already used some of this variety with less accuracy and it was nice, but this cup was distinctly better. 

I am not massively enthusiastic about checking temperatures or weighing things, but I want to stick to my resolution. 

What advice can this sub give me? I use the aeropress and v60 for myself and the French press if it’s for more people than just me. Thanks in advance. I hope this is okay to be requesting. Mods, please delete if unhelpful."

0,"How do you drink the coffee that comes out of a bialetti moka pot? I'm a barista, but only use genuine espresso machines. Not willing to buy a homemade espresso machine, I've heard a lot about bialetti moka pots. Their espresso-like, but not officially, due to bars of pressure and whatnot.

I've watched a few videos on how to use the moka pot, and will probably playtest a few times to get the hang of it.

But how do you actually drink the coffee concoction that comes out of a moka pot?

Is it meant to be utilized like a latte? So do you diute it with water, to make an Americano or Long Black? Do you drink it like that?

It's kind of confusing, because I still want the caffeine but it's hard to gauge how much is a cup. Like with drip coffee machines, I know one cup is one cup and I can count the number of cups I drink. So can I with espresso.

For those unfamiliar, a Nel - or drip pot - is a cloth-filter pour over brewer made by [Hario]( I was gifted the one cup version a couple months ago and, although it’s a BEAUTIFUL brewer in my opinion, I couldn’t figure out a good, consistent recipe for the life of me. There are a few recipes online and from Hario that I tried, but nothing seemed to work well. 

I’m writing all this for two reasons. First, I would love to hear from others with this brewer! Did you experience similar frustrations? What recipe(s) have you found that work well? And second, I just wanted to share what ended up working for me in the hopes that it might work for you too!

Recipe:
25g coffee, similar grind to a v60
150g water, 94 degrees Celsius

Pre-wet filter with warm water. 
Pour in grounds. Use a chopstick or similar tool to make a mound in the middle. 
Imprint a small divot at the top of this mound. 

Start pouring water. Aim for 25g over 25 seconds. I know this is really slow, but just focus on wetting all your grounds for the most part. 
Then, pour 100g over 75 seconds, in a similar fashion to how you’d pour for a v60. 
Finally, pour 25g down the middle of the grounds over about 20 seconds. 

After you’ve finished pouring, I normally wait for about a minute (which might be too long, honestly) for drawdown. 

And that’s it! Hope someone finds this helpful! Let me know if you’d modify it in any way :)"

Pressure gauge mod
Rancilio wand mod
New gasket for group head
Tamper

0,"AstraPro - A $2000 paperweight. Looking for suggestions, help, anything really. After doing a lot of research I landed on the AstraPro because of reviews that said both quality and service were top notch.  Bought it brand new in February of 2019 and used it daily with no issues.  Then I had to leave town for an extended stay out of state in August of 2020.  Left it **unplugged** on the counter.  
  
Came back in December of 2021, plugged it in and no go.  Clicks, hums, then stops.  No heat, no pressure.  I call into service and one guy says I'll need a multimeter to do some testing.  OK, I go buy one.  Then the holidays get in the way and we play phone tag for a bit.  
  
I finally get through last Thursday but a different tech answers.  No multimeter testing or anything.  ""Press this reset button inside and see if that works.""  Nope.  He wipes his hands of it and says ""You need to buy either a vibration pump or the computer.""  He tells me I am on my own and gives me a phone number of a place that services their machines in my state.
  
I call them up and they tell me they have never had a contract to service Astra machines and they are surprised I was given their number.  They give me a possible alternate place.  Same answer, they don't work on Astra machines.  I call Astra back and the guy literally says ""I don't know what to tell you.  Wait until Monday and call the person you spoke to before.""  Seriously?  Yes, seriously.
  
So today I was able to get through to the original guy.  He was a lot more helpful with diagnosing.  We did eventually trace it down to the fact that the pump has an issue.  BUT...they no longer use my type of pump and Astra will not stand behind the product to send me a replacement, which apparently will be expensive, because it requires a retrofit with a different pump.
  
The pump is a Fluid-O-Tech 1106RLIFB2E0000.  Five total search results.  Apparently none are the exact one.
  
So now I am left with a **$2000 paperweight** when I thought I was investing in a system that would last a lifetime.  

The place I bought the system from apparently has no functional phone number anymore.  Also great.
  
If anyone has any ideas or sources for a new pump, I would appreciate it.
  
Would also love some feedback on anyone else's experience with Astra.  Because this really **sucks**."

0,"Bialetti Moka Pot: 2 cup or 4 cup? Hi fellow coffee lovers!

I'm struggling to make a choice between two moka pot sizes mentioned in the title.

I'm aiming at preparing a 220-250 ml flat white resembling drink. I guess it would take 1:1 coffee to milk ratio with a Moka Pot, so I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to get a reasonably strong drink with the amount of coffee that usually gets out of 2 cup pot.

3tz would probably do the job, but ironically enough Bialetti doesn't offer such size with their stainless steel lineup...

I'd love to hear your opinions on that and please do share how much coffee you get from your 2tz and 4tz moka pots on average.

0,"First timer coffee - am I being ripped off? Hello, very nervous about posting here but glad to have found this sub.

I'm in my late twenties and I always thought I hated coffee. Well it turns out, I just hate instant black coffee! Over a month ago I had an oat latte made fresh and it was a m a z i n g, so naturally I started researching to find out how I can do this at home. 

I decided for the first time I would stick to simple and cheaper and invest in a midrange coffee grinder that had lots of great reviews (and was recommended on here as a beginner one) and bags of coffee beans of varying roasts to experiment. I also got a French press as that's what I want to try first, before going down the rabbit hole that is expresso. 

I got the bits from coffee friend and placed the order. It was dispatched quickly and the coffee has been arriving separately, but not the grinder. It keeps getting delayed. Onto the issue: one of the bags of coffee beans (the most expensive one) arrived opened. It's got the vent on the side, sure. But the top is not fully sealed and is exposed and the beans can fall out if I tip the bag. Now everything I've read on the guides, YouTube tutorials, posts etc, say that coffee goes off? That being exposed to air ruins it so you want to use it as quickly as possible, use air tight containers, and store it correctly. Some say you want to use it within a week of roast, and some say a month. I'm concerned about being stuck with a load of coffee that's exposed to air that I never get to grind as the coffee machine keeps getting delayed (and currently has no expected delivery time).

I emailed coffee friend, and perhaps made the mistake of letting them know this was my first time trying and buying coffee. Because they informed me the coffee it meant to be open/packaged this way, and will last 3 months like this ? And that what I should do is just buy their air tight containers (and kindly gave me a link of their choices...) They also let me know that I can pay a £9 return fee for each bag as well ( not paying for a replacement, just paying to send it back). They did not answer why the tracking info has not updated with the coffee machine and has timed out.

Am I being played here? Or have I completely misunderstood my research? I feel a bit vulnerable as I don't have anyone around me I can ask for help, and as a student who's just spent hundreds on coffee equipment to be stuck with beans that may be going off, I'm worried. Thanks for taking the time to read this far xoxo"

0,"My thoughts after trying mail-order frozen coffee pods from Cometeer Because YOLO, I ordered a box of mail-order frozen coffee. These are my thoughts.

The coffee taste isn't as good as fresh ground pour over. Though, they do offer many different roasters and roast levels. My assesment is it's neither ""bad"" nor ""good.""

I'd say it tastes somewhere about the same as not-quite-fresh preground mid-level beans. Think Peets preground that you bought at Target, which was 6 weeks after its roast date. Or maybe about the same as old beans you bought at World Market, and you ground them at the store. 

There isn't a stale taste, but there isn't a fresh taste either. One major thing it's lacking, in my opinion, is the aroma of fresh ground coffee. I'd actually go so far as to say it doesn't even have the aroma of preground folgers. The aromatics of fresh coffee must not survive the flash freezing process.

It's definitely better tasting than instant or Folgers. Via is probably the best instant I've had, which I consider fine for what it is.

I'm not too sure who I'd recommend this frozen coffee to. Maybe some bougie folx who currently use instant, or pods, or get coffee at a chain like Starbucks. The pods are $2 each, so it's not like you save much money over Starbucks -- though you do get more options for roasts and roasters. The entire package and container is curbside recyclable, so that might appeal to some people.

The pods should be kept frozen (they arrive in an insulated box with dry ice -- for god's sake don't accidently touch the dry ice!). They say once thawed, they retain ""quality"" for 24 hours. You use the frozen puck if you're making a hot drink, but if you're making iced coffee or iced latte you'd let a pod thaw in the fridge overnight.

Myself, I have a Decent and make my own espresso and lattes at home. I'm not a professional taster by any means, but I do try basically any coffee and coffee brewing method I can find. I've owned nearly every kind of brewing device you can buy -- including Nespresso and Keurig as well as drip, aeropress, v60, moka, etc., etc. So hopefully my assessment will add to the conversation.

0,"Jura E6 cleaning My 5 yr old De’Longhi is dying on me and looking to replace it. We usually drink espressos or long blacks at home since I can’t be bothered to froth the milk with the wand on the machine. I’d love a cappuccino occasionally and have heard and read a lot of good things about the Jura machine which offers both a great espresso (for a fully auto) and milk based drinks. 

However my concern is maintaining the machine. How often do I have to replace the milk tube and do I have to use the milk cleaning tablets to clean the milk system at the end of each day I use it? Sounds like it’s gonna add up to a lot of costs if I end up having my one cappuccino a day.. for that reason, I’m thinking of sticking to a more basic De’Longhi with the milk wand which can be removed for washing, but their espressos aren’t as good as Jura although they’re alright 

The maintenance costs (especially when using the milk frother) will be the main decision maker. Thanks!"
0,"Cold brew for nitro dispenser? I got [one of these]( nitro cold brew dispensers for christmas. I typically make cold brew by simply mixing 900g water into 150g coffee (6:1 ratio), let it sit out room temp overnight, and then strain and use it as a 1:4 concentrate. 

But for this nitro thing I’m not sure what to do. Should I make it less of a concentrate so that I can just drink it straight up, or could it still work as a concentrate somehow?  The one middle ground I was thinking of was to make my concentrate as usual, dilute it in the nitro dispenser, and then pour and drink straight up out of the dispenser. Thoughts?

Followup question: the kit also came with those filter bags that you can add grounds into and then just fish out at the end. I’m assuming that making cold brew with a coffee teabag instead allowing the grounds to float freely with the water may not have good results…but has anyone tried it?"

I’ve finally hit financial status to be able to upgrade my grinder (Porlex Tall). I have a 3 month old, so convenience is a plus. I was looking into the Encore last year, but since the $30 price bump I’ve been looking at the Virtuoso+. Is the $80 price difference worth it? I know I could change the burrs myself, but don’t want to go through the hassle. 

Also, how different is the quality of the brew? I do pour overs (V60, Wave, and Chemex). My Porlex is so inconsistent - one setting causes me to end up with mud, the next is like pouring water through peppercorns. 

I’m excited, just don’t want to set my expectations too high. I’m looking for that cafe level pour over that I can make at home."

0,"Tricolate Infodump About two months ago, I got the Tricolate after seeing Scott Rao's Instagram posts about it. I had high hopes and was mostly satisfied, and generally very impressed. After using it 110 times so far, I feel ready to share my thoughts about it. If you're not familiar, the Tricolate is a no-bypass brewer. In almost all pour-over brewers, some water can get around the coffee bed, lowering extraction and possibly reducing evenness. It's certainly not a terrible problem, but eliminating it can be quite beneficial. The brewer looks like a wide Aeropress with a Melodrip-like dispersion screen at the top. Because there is no filter and are no ridges along the sides, water cannot get around the coffee bed. 

Because bypass is eliminated, sensible brew ratios with the Tricolate change. I found my happy place in the 1:20 to 1:22 range. It's also possible to grind a lot finer. I have been grinding a little over one full rotation finer for a 15:330 brew on the Tricolate than a 22:374 brew on the Stagg \[X\] on my Kinu m47 Phoenix. The reason for that is not super obvious, but I suspect that the reasonably low agitation is a factor. If the coffee bed starts out flat and homogenous and is kept that way by swirling, not messing with the bed is enough to avoid channels. Additionally, because of the brewer's design, there aren't the same issues with having a lot of bypass as you might have with a Melodrip in a v60. Brew times are also very long. I've had good results with brews around 10 minutes and generally live in the 6 to 8-minute range. 

Overall, I like the brewer a lot. The coffee is very good, the 32% savings in coffee that I get in my particular case is very welcome, and the brewer is reasonably easy to use, but not as easy as I had hoped. Unfortunately, I don't have a refractometer, so I can't talk about extraction numbers, but between the big ratios, no bypass, and the finer grind, it's pretty clear that extractions are high. The coffee also tastes great and is very evenly extracted. For the first time, I've been able to consistently completely eliminate any tiny trace of astringency in the coffee I brew. Some people have noticed a reduction in aroma and complexity with super high extractions and long brew times. I have noticed this to an extent in the comparisons I have done, but in my day-to-day coffee drinking, it's not such a prominent effect that I feel like I'm missing anything. There's also plenty of sweetness and acidity; and excellent clarity. I think that the clarity is probably because the lower agitation forces fewer fines through the filter, and due to the brewer forcing all the water through the coffee bed, which is actually a better filter than the filter paper itself. 

In my particular case, I think I save more coffee than most people would because when I use the Stagg \[X\], I make a little more coffee than I really want so that I can ensure that there is sufficient bed depth. I've had issues with consistency with the Stagg \[X\] with smaller doses, which is why that's necessary for me. With the Tricolate, low agitation seems to help to make thinner bed depths viable, but I haven't had any success with doses lower than 12g, and it gets a little sketchy below 15g. 

The shower screen at the top of the brewer is very useful for the reasons above, but it's not as great as I had hoped. If you pour in the center the whole time with a gooseneck kettle, a disproportionate amount of water will fall in the center of the brewer because of water's adhesive and cohesive properties, creating a not-insignificant divot. A very hard swirl is needed to fix that, making clogging quite likely. Even with a normal kettle, that effect persists, but to a lesser extent. I find it best to move the kettle around in a circle like a normal pour-over while pouring quite fast to maintain a water column above the screen when using a gooseneck kettle; or to start by going in circles until a very high water column has been built up, then stay in the center for the rest of the time if using a regular kettle. It's also relatively easy to clog the filter if you swirl too hard. Three good swirls during the bloom are usually sufficient to saturate everything, and it's best to be gentle with subsequent swirls. It's easy to consistently avoid after a little practice, but was initially very frustrating for me. 

I've used a few different techniques with the Tricolate, and my favorite so far has been the one that Lance Hedrick published recently. It starts with a dose of 15g and consists of a 2 minute-long 3:1 swirled bloom, followed by 2 pours of equal size up to a 1:22 ratio, each followed by a gentle swirl, starting the second pour when the water drains to about 1 centimeter above the coffee bed. A simpler bloom + 1 pour recipe also can work quite well, it's just a little harder to get a flat coffee bed because of the very high water column. Assuming you get a flat bed and avoid clogging, it's pretty easy to do a good job. Starting with a flat coffee bed is very important. I like to shake the brewer hard from side to side and in circles while keeping it in contact with the counter (to keep it level) to achieve that. Some people like to WDT. I haven't found that super necessary, but it's probably worth playing around with. It's theoretically possible to replicate the Tricolate with an Aeropress and a Melodrip, but I never had good results with that when I tried it out. It's worth a shot but don't get your hopes up. It's also possible to brew very strong coffee with the Tricolate, and it works well for flash brew. I haven't played with either of those too much because I don't really like super strong coffee and because it's winter in New York where I live, respectively. 

I would highly recommend buying a Tricolate if it at all interests you. Regalia Coffee in New York City is a distributor in the US, and I got mine from them. It is on the expensive side. I paid $65 US for mine (100 filters included), plus shipping and tax. I justify that by assuming that if coffee costs on average 6.47 cents per gram ($22 for a 340g bag), it will pay for itself in 143 brews that I make with the Tricolate instead of the Stagg \[X\] (saving 7 grams per brew). That estimate doesn't account for the increased cost of filters because the cost per filter between the Tricolate and the Stagg isn't very different. 

I firmly believe that the Tricolate and brewers like it are the future of coffee brewing. Efficiency is a compelling benefit in a world where coffee is going to become increasingly scarce, and I think there's a lot of potential for innovation around it. I would be very interested in a metal Tricolate with a heating coil to keep the slurry as hot as possible. I hope that this massive wall of text is useful to at least a few people. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have. 

tldr: the tricolate is an excellent no-bypass brewer that makes it easy to get very high extractions and save use less coffee. If you want a new brewer that is a little different, strongly consider buying it."

I bought my wife the Breville Barista Express for Christmas this year because she love making coffee and wanted to expand her knowledge and coffee ""game"".  Honestly I know nothing, I don't even drink coffee, I am just an engineer who has now spent about 10+ hours total trying to dial this thing in.  I am now convinced that coffee is in fact, an art.  This means I am useless for the most part. So far, I have watched a ton of videos but seem to be missing something.

The problem:  Good pressure with tons of coffee grounds or bad pressure with decent amount of coffee grounds

Coffee:  One line coffee (Columbus, OH) - Method Blend Espresso (don't know if I could use links here)

Portafilter: Non-Pressurized doubleshot 

**Best configuration thus far**

* Internal grind setting: 3, came factory at 6 but this was giving little to no pressure even at 2 external
* External grind setting: 4

My observations:  I have had the internal settings at 3-6 so far and have tried roughly 15-20 different configurations thus far.  Example -  internal 3, external 3-8 ; Internal 4, external 2-7 ; internal 5, external 1-6 ; internal 6, external 1-6.  

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  We know that going with the pressurized portafilter will likely fix these issues easily, issue being is that you might as well use a much cheaper machine if you are using the pressurized portafilter.

0,"Long term experience with a 14oz Ember Mug 2, including Ember Customer Support TL;DR - if you want your coffee at the perfect temp from the first to last drop, an Ember is ""worth it"" at this point, as the main software issues that plagued it for a long time seem to now be resolved.  Your coffee will stay at an exact temperature you specify.

Pros:

Allows coffee to cool to your preferred temp, and then keeps it at that exact temperature all day long if you keep it on the coaster.

Battery life off the coaster is about an hour, if you start with a drink that is already hot.

App and mug firmware have been updated, and seem to be stable.

Cons:

Sometimes finicky app and bluetooth connection.  Seems to be stable for now, but will it remain this way?  

Charging coaster uses live pins that contact the bottom of the mug.  These pins will get stuck and the coaster no longer works.  If something metal falls on the pins it can spark.  All of this could be resolved by using Qi Wireless charging - it makes no sense that they don't use induction charging.

Battery in mug is non-replaceable and if it fails, the mug has to be replaced.

Battery will not charge while it is keeping your drink hot - mug has to be empty or manually turned off in the app for the battery to charge.

;#x200B;

;#x200B;

I've now owned an Ember Mug since Christmas 2019, and have used it off and on since I got it.  For the first 6 months or so I used it pretty much every day, despite there being some frustrations with the app, I was able to work around these and continued to use it.  Around this time though one of the charging pins on the coaster stuck, and getting the mug to charge was a pain in the butt - I had to have a tiny piece of aluminum foil over the pin so that it would make contact with the mug.  At some point in there as well the software was almost non-functional.  The mug would lose connection every time, the custom LED color would never set, etc.  I'd have to unpair it and re-pair it to bluetooth, and generally it was just not worth it.  

This winter I decided to give it another try - the issue with the charging coaster was still there, but there was an app update and a mug firmware update that effectively resolved all other issues I had.  No longer does the mug disconnect and have to be re-paired, the custom color sets, I can force the mug to heat a drink if its below 100 degrees, etc.  Rather than being a frustrating experience, it was, other than the charging coaster, a pleasure to use.  

So I started looking for a new coaster, but just didn't want to spend $35 on a new one.  On a whim I contacted Ember Customer support to see if there was anything the could do since the pin sticking seems to be a common problem. To my surprise, with just a few photos sent to them, they sent me a new coaster, even though my mug is long past the initial 1 year warranty.

I have not experienced any of the flaking issues that others have mentioned - I have a black mug, and the interior when washed still looks new.  

It seems like every time someone mentions an Ember, someone else talks about how their vacuum insulated mug will keep their coffee hot for 24 hours or some other such thing, which I feel misses the entire point of this mug - it's job is not to keep your beverage super hot, but rather to keep it at the perfect drinking temperature.  When I pour in coffee from the carafe, it's over 165 degrees.  The mug allows it to cool, and only applies heat to keep it at your preferred drinking temperature.  I have owned and used insulated mugs for literally decades and they have two problems - the first is that raw stainless steel changes the flavor of coffee, making it noticeably worse, and second they just keep the drink at an undrinkable temp for far too long.  I don't want to pick up my mug three hours later and have it still burn me.  The Ember does solve both those issues, and keeps me from drinking lukewarm coffee out of another mug.  

Ultimately I am glad I didn't pay for my Ember, since the overall experience hasn't been perfect, but there is no doubt that I enjoy using it, especially during the winter."

0,"Recommendations for Pour Over for ~450 mg coffee So, I currently use a Hario Woodneck (480ml size with the reusable cotton/flannel filter) which I love because it allows more body in the cup than most paper filter methods I’ve tried. 

However, for my morning work to-go coffee, I make around 450-500 mg. Unfortunately for the larger quantities of beans (using about a 1:15 ratio), I find that the filter is a bit overwhelmed in terms of size, which - despite trying to adjust grind size - causes the last 200mg or so to filter through too slowly (hopefully I’m explaining that correctly). 

I’m looking for a recommendation for a bit of a larger style for pour over that retains a similar body and profile for the coffee.  I’m open to using a paper filter if required but I don’t want it to end up too “clean” of a cup, which happens often with paper - particularly with the Chemex, IMO

0,"V60 help - looking for more body, oils I've been doing pour over coffee for years, but never with that much detail. I used to measure and so on, but I'm generally satisfied by eyeballing things now. I switched to a V60 about a year ago, and still can't seem to get things exactly right. A few days ago, I miraculously brewed a perfect cup, but can't for the life of me figure out how. I tend to like my coffee very robust, and an oily slick is a good sign for me, but I rarely get this out of my V60. Any immediate ideas? I grind on the finer side of medium, use a gooseneck at about 205F, bloom, and pour spiraling at a rate that usually finishes the kettle and allows the water to draw down."

0,"With or without cream? What are some great tips for enjoying your coffee? I just recently (earlier this year) discovered the joys of freshly ground coffee.  It is a freakin life changer for me.  The downside though, is that I still use some of the flavored creamers.  I have been trying different coffee beans to see what I like, and so far, it’s a local dark roast called “dark as dark.”  The description is dark chocolate, smoky and sweet.   wanted to see what kind of tips there were to enjoying coffee.  I can enjoy coffee in pretty much any form, but I really only know half and half… and flavored creamers.  I don’t have a preference, other than not too sweet and not soy (although I may give it a try again).  With that being said, what are your favorite ways to drink your coffee?  I dont usually put a ton of creamer in my coffee and I dont add any sugar, but I want to experiment with flavoring the coffee to my taste…

Also, if you have more coffee suggestions, that would be great.  

My top three coffee beans so far are:

Blanchard’s dark is dark
Devocion - which was a Christmas present.
Blanchard’s blend 

The only kinds I’ve tried are the ones you would find in a grocery store… stumptown, Starbucks, and a couple of local ones.

I really want to try out other brands and would even treat myself to some super expensive ($50) bags of coffee beans as well.

Thanks for suggestions!"
0,"Is a French Press right for me? I'm sick of the Keurig on my counter, and I'm considering getting a French Press. 

Everything I've read says that it's an absolute must that I grind my own beans and that the beans be roasted in the last 2-3 weeks. The thing is, I don't actually drink coffee every day.  More like once or twice a week. So is it still worth it if my beans are going to be sitting around for weeks at a time?

As an aside, is it very difficult to use a manual grinder?  Electric grinders look expensive, and I'd rather not spend much on this experiment given that I'm not a daily coffee drinker.

0,"Turkish coffee - What is the effect of brewing time and heat intensity? I'm new to Turkish coffee brewing, and am interested in the science of how altering different variables in brewing technique change the finished product.  Or at least, what people have experienced with these.

Many instructions online say to use a low to medium heat and just wait until the foam rises, and that this takes ""a few minutes.""  I was reading how the Ibrik Championship winners try to keep to brew time to about 2 and a half minutes.  One pre-heats his water to 60°C and mixes before putting on the heat, while another starts with the water what looks like room temp and lets the coffee float on top for the first minute of heating before mixing.

However when I've gone to make it myself, I find that even medium heat takes a long time, sometimes 5-8 minutes.  If I want it to be shorter, I have to really use a high heat source, like a Bunsen burner when my boss isn't around, to get the foam to rise in less than three minutes.  I've also seen that some people use brass alcohol stoves which I know don't get very hot.  Is this idea of having a short brew time more preference?  Does it make it taste better, or just different?"

0,"1Z-Presso J-MAX coffee grinder not working, please help! Greetings guys!
I am a complete newbie to this whole coffee madness and I bought this J-Max as my first grinder and wanted to get into espresso making. However it does not seem to work. I already texted the manufacturer, but I am not sure when will they answer and its really pissing me off, so I was hoping some experts here could help!
So the issue is that when I tried to grind it with it, I heard a big pop and the handle just spinning freely without doing anything. I took it apart a few times and tried to adjust the inner setting. If I set it too tight with the rotator settings, I can't even move the inner one, if I loosen it, it keeps spinning freely. Earlier I managed to set the inner one to 0 as it is in the manual, then selected a 120 click for espresso. But again, as soon as I started to move the Handle, boom pop and its completely free spinning now (inside setting). Did I mess it up? Wish I could upload a video. I am really confused. Have I broken the machine or is it faulty by default? Now I can't seem to get the inner setting clicking. Its either stuck (too tight) or free spinning.
I would be grateful for any help. Can I somehow upload pics or vids here?"

It would cover a lot of bases for me, seems extremely versatile/convenient and not too pricey.  I am however worried about the longevity and reliability.  Does anyone have experience with Ninja?

So I made a cup of coffee afterwards and realized that there's some sort of misalignment because the Ode makes this knocking sound when running... it sounds really bad, so I wonder if by tightening the screw I threw the whole thing out of alignment.

There is however a growing concern regarding my Brikka and that is the threads of the two main components that screw together. Lately, it becomes increasingly difficult to screw tight the boiler and kettle together for some reason, I believe it is due to the fact that there is paint present on the threads of the boiler (just like demonstrated in this photo\[credit: Avi Schneor\]: [ )

I make about 2-3 brews a day and every day I give a thorough clean(to prevent old coffee and other stuff from building up) which includes using a wet toothbrush to clean spots that are difficult to just wipe with a paper towel - after going with the toothbrush on the threads and wiping these areas there's almost always a black residue left on the paper towel.

I am asking for help on this matter as I don't want to get to the point in which I won't be able to brew due to insufficient sealing between the two major components.

Is there something I can do to assist with the screwing of the two components together?

2. The Gaggia Classic Pro now has a Prestige edition from Whole Latte Love. Are the upgrades here  worth the added money? It seems that the biggest factors towards taste from that prestige edition will be the Silicone Group Gasket (didn't know this was an issue with the Pro) and the 18g precision basket.

The only reason is would it be better to skip the Prestige for the Pro and just get a VST basket and a decent tamper?

0,"French Press: Pre-soaking ground beans in cold water? Hello coffee lovers and all others!

Here's a short story about my question, **tldr** at the end.

;#x200B;

When backpacking in New Zealand me and my friends ended up at this festival in a forest. After the first night we woke up hung over - as expected, and started our small cooking stove to boil water for my favourite routine of the day - morning coffee.

We all sat around the pot patiently waiting for the water to boil when out of nowhere a large round man appeared and asked us if we were making coffee. Heads hurting and some of us still affected by the drugs from the previous night we nodded and asked if he wanted some as well.

He hadn't slept yet and was probably on something because compared our barley alive coffee craving group he was excited and full of energy - and of course he would like some coffee. He introduced himself, sat down and immediately started talking about how he used to work as a barista, loved to smoke opium and he had some sort of time medallion from Dr. Who(?) that he showed us. It was a very odd experience especially since most of our group came from Sweden where being this open and talkative is almost frowned upon or at least very unusual. 

After a while the water started boiling and he asked if he could show us something he learned as a barista that would make our coffee taste better. I just wanted my coffee but someone said something affirmative and he started to explain about cold blooming. By pouring some cold water on the ground beans before pouring the hot water it would help to release oils that would otherwise become stuck inside the grounds. He did this and showed us the oils/foam that started collecting at the surface. We nodded and some of us was beginning to tire of this non stop talking opium smoking guy. But of course none of us would say this, so he continued to explain. After the grounds had been soaked, stirred and released all of its oils he started pouring the hot water with the coffee beaker tilted. He poured slowly and explained that by doing it this way would make the coffee vary in strength depending on if you poured from the top or bottom. And then we waited.

After a while he pushed down the plunger and soon we had coffee in our cups. The guy left and after waiting a bit longer for the coffee to cool a bit I drank... and it was very good. The taste was more rounded, sweeter and not as bitter. I didn't know it then, but from there on my way of making coffee was forever changed. 

I don't do the pouring from the side, but I always soak the ground coffee in cold water (room temp) before the hot water. I've tried it without the cold water and I don't find experience as pleasant.

;#x200B;

Tldr;

A guy who liked to smoke opium showed us if you pour cold water (room temp) on your coffee grounds and lightly shake/stir the beaker before the hot water it releases oils that would otherwise get trapped in the beans (or burnt by the shock of hot water) ... or something.

0,"Buying a good machine for under £200….help So during lockdown I decided that as I couldn’t go to my favourite coffee shop to get my usual latte/flat white, It was time to see about getting my own espresso machine to start making something that passes for coffee at home. as an absolute beginner I went for right at the bottom of the market for my first machine. We’re talking like £35 (Salter Ek3131) 

That machine has served me ok. It’s allowed me to get used to making coffee and helped me appreciate that this is something I want to keep doing. A year on from getting that first machine I’m ready to invest abit more money to acquire something of higher quality. But I’m faced with an espresso machine market I frankly no nothing about. I’ve read reviews and looked though ‘top 10 lists’ but everything I find seems to come with flaws. 

I have a budget of ideally £150-200 which I know isn’t going to get me a top level machine. But will be something that I hope is a vast improvement on what I have.

I’d be really grateful for your top suggestions.

I have a Wilfa Svart that has developed quite a bad problem in the past few weeks. The motor seems to chug unevenly and will often stop when grinding coffee. It's doing this with different roasts and grind sizes and I've tried running the motor first and pouring the coffee in to the same result. It has been regularly cleaned and maintained.

This video is not mine but demonstrates the exact same problem:

 bought this grinder in July of 2020 so I'm out of any warranty or replacement period - this is more of a last-ditch post to see if anyone has any suggestions that could help fix this issue?

If not and it's a dud then consider this a PSA to be cautious when buying one of these - it worked perfectly for the first year and a bit, and I hadn't seen this issue in many reviews but it's ruined now. Has anyone else experienced this?"

Does anyone have any interest in joining a group buy [for these Gorilla Gear Burrs]( These are the same burrs Lance Hedrick spoke of in [his Fellow Ode video]( 

The manufacturer is located in New Zealand so if you were to buy these and ship to east coast US for example, the shipping cost alone is around $100 for just one set of burrs. I spoke to the owner and he said if we can get at least 20 people, he is willing to sell the 64mm burrs at 210 NZD which is 142 USD (current list price is 270 NZD/182 USD) and shipping to the US for 20 Burr sets is roughly 300 NZD (about 10 USD per set) and 40 Burr sets is roughly 400 NZD or around 7 USD per set. The burrs are manufactured in New Zealand and are subject to a 4.2% import duty fee. Once the burrs are stateside, I or some other designee could send them out in padded USPS flat rate envelopes at around $10 each. I'd recommend that everyone should use PayPal goods and services (not friends and family) to protect everyone in the group buy, which PayPal's fee is 3.49% plus 49 cents. So a total estimated cost if the group hits only 20 buyers would be around $175 and will only get cheaper if more people enter."

My question to you is should I buy a new french press, or should I try a different apparatus? People who have used different types, what do you think?

0,"Critique my Aeropress recipe I am new to coffee and i think i finally found a recipe i enjoy for the aeropress.


Here is what i was trying to achieve:



* I would prefer to use smaller quantity of coffee if possible. The 35g recipes are interesting but they get costly if you use quality beans.


* I like my cup to not be weak and be full of flavors. Some recipes i tried felt ""tea like"" and reminded of my nespresso cups, not good.


* At the same time, i like to have a bigger cup of coffee, probably around 280ml. I dislike small 200ml cups.



When i tried the inverted recipes, the issue is i usually end up with really small amounts of coffee. Then i can add water but that usually taste ""watered down"" to me. If i want to do a latte, that is great tho.


So here is the recipe i tried today which i enjoyed:


Around 18g of coffee, at 16 setting on my encore (so on the fine side, but not too fine).



* Put 2 filters in upright position (not inverted) on empty cup.


* Put 18g coffee first, then add 95F water until it reach the 4


* Stir for 10 seconds


* Add water again until it reach the 4


* Put the plunger in quickly.


* Wait for 4 minutes


* SLOWLY press.



For me the result was a nice ~300 ml cup of coffee that felt strong but not too much. Maybe a ""connaisseur"" would say it was a bit on the over extracted side of things, i might try 3 minutes instead tomorrow :P"

0,"TopBrewer - $11k Espresso Machine by Scanomat - any experience? TopBrewer is a commercial coffee machine probably most distinguished by the minimalist appearance - see photo - and that you place your order via tablet or phone. 

It doesn't list a price but I have seen articles cite between $8,000 and $15,000. The target market seems to be more workplaces and hotels rather than individual consumers. 

Question: I haven't found many reviews of people reviewing how the coffee tastes and how well the machine works - has anyone tried it?

I've seen a few older Reddit threads about it but not many actual testimonials; mostly people scoffing at the price and (presumed) low-quality coffee output.

I'd guess this is not going to appeal to people who are serious about their coffee and would rather spend more time on prep for a superior tasting coffee - but the simple user interface plus high-volume capacity seems appealing for a group setting like a workplace, retail shop, or a condo/apartment shared amenity.

0,"Mignon Filtro *Silent* (or similar?) I’m looking for a super quiet electric brew coffee grinder.

I recently upgraded to a Eureka Mignon Specialita from my Baratza Encore. I’ve realized that: (1) I *really* like a quiet grinder like the Specialita and (2) I’m going to want to leave the Specialita dialed in for Espresso, and have another grinder for drip. The Encore is OK for my drip needs, but it’s loud. Hand grinder isn’t a good option for me for drip.

In Europe, Eureka sells a Mignon Filtro Silent, which is optimized for drip (like the regular Filtro), and has their “silent” sound dampening. It lists for like $225. In the US, I would need to go to a Mignon Brew Pro for both brew-optimized and silent. Like $679. 

Has anyone had luck ordering European models shipped to US? Which vendor? They seem so much cheaper.

Or swapping burrs in a Silenzio to make it brew-optimal? 

The most coarse I would need ground at this time is for Chemex/Moccamaster. The Specialita does just fine, but if I’m spending the money on a “silent” Mignon I’d like to get something optimized for drip. Anything with a simple timer would work. The Ode fits the bill, but I don’t think it’s too quiet.

This is my first Reddit post, sorry to go so broad with such a narrow topic.

For what it’s worth, if you haven’t heard (or not-heard) one of these “silent” Mignon grinders in action - they are very nice. And the grind quality is awesome."

0,"Your take on Organic Coffee - Yes or No **Why Organic?**

When it comes to pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, coffee is the third-most sprayed agricultural crop in the world. Most major coffee producers coat their crops with a witches’ brew of toxic chemicals to fight intruders and increase crop yields. That said, the question is not whether these chemicals make their way into your morning cup. At peak temperatures above 450 degrees, the roasting process will most likely burn off any residual chemicals. The real question is what do these chemicals do to the environment and communities where they are sprayed? The data is clear; the effects on groundwater, nearby crops, and people’s health are well documented.

In addition to being better for those growing our coffee, we believe that a commitment to organic simply produces better coffee. Without the advantage of herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides, coffee farmers have to take better care of their trees to experience the same quality and crop yields per tree as their non-organic competitors. Organic farmers have to choose viable soil and water sources in order to avoid adding synthetic nutrients later. They have to grow their coffee at higher altitudes, which dissuades many insects and parasitic plants, resulting in a slower-developing, more complex-flavored coffee bean.

Organic farmers have to accept a trade-off of lower overall yield in exchange for a more bio-diverse habitat. In return, coffee roasters and their customers pay them a premium to continue the practice. We think it’s money well spent.

From the ground up, we’re always looking for new ways to bring you exceptional coffee and tea with as little environmental footprint as possible.

I've owned a Moka Express (9 cup, I think it is) for years and just got it back out for another try.  My parents gave me it as a birthday gift.

They have one and use it all the time but when my dad offers me coffee, I politely decline because it's always so bitter it makes me want to cry. They just put it on full heat and wait for it to boil dry (hence the bitter as hell brew). 

Now, I've been watching videos about how to use them properly and this morning, I thought I'd give it another go but at this point, I've wasted a whole bag of beans.

My conclusion so far is that unless you boil the absolute *crap* out of the thing, nothing ever comes out of the tower and when it does, it's more bitter than a song by The Smiths. 😅

I've tried using low-ish gas hob settings and so far, on this latest attempt, I've been waiting 20 minutes and all that's come out of the tower is a very gentle stream of steam. If I turn it up at all, it starts boiling, which is not the idea, I understand. 

All the mating surfaces are clean, the funnel isn't damaged or mis-shapen, I've used hot water, filled to the fill line, the coffee (ground a little coarser than espresso) has been filled to just below the rim of the funnel and gently tapped to level it. 

I cannot wait an hour for a coffee, nor do I want to drink something that tastes like hell. 🤢 It's currently sounding like it's boiling away but nothing worth speaking of has come out of the tower.

Now I tried pre-ground coffee, once ground fresh at a coffee roastery and once good quality store coffee, both for filter. The grind size is in both cases way finer than my self ground coffee. And with that the brew time increased quiet a lot to around 5 to 6 minutes, leaving the coffee overextracted.
And I only brewed for one cup (250 g water). I can't imagine brewing a whole liter of coffee.
Did anyone else experience that and if yes, what is your explanation?"

0,"It finally happened, I got covid and now everything tastes completely off. Tested positive for covid on New Year's day, but was experiencing symptoms a few days before. I knew something was off when I got a large order of coffee from one of my favorite roasters (1 250g bag, 3 100 g bag, all a week off roast date and all from different regions like Ethiopia, Kenya, and a few blends on the 7th.) I knew something was wrong when I could barely taste anything with my usual settings. I tried several pouring techniques and recipes, I could taste the strength, but not really the flavor. I used my v60, hario switch, origami, but nothing worked. I went max settings on my grinder and even finer than most medium/fine recommendations. At first, I thought it was the beans, but even the same bags of coffee I was brewing before covid taste extremely off. I will probably stick to cheap bags from my usual local roasters for a month or so, but I will definitely update. Today would be around day 14 so I have hope. 

For those curious, my coffee tastes extremely weak and unflavored, like diluted coffee/ hot water. Doesn't matter the ratio or how much water all of my coffees taste very similar, only the smell is different. Even my strongest tasting coffee pre covid, taste like a keurig coffee now.

0,"Usability differences: Hario Kettle vs. Fellow EKG? Hi :) I currently own and use a Hario Kettle for my pour overs and such. As the Fellow EKG kettle seems to be quite popular and I have no way of getting my hands on one to try it out, I thought I'd ask here. What are the differences between the two regarding how it is/feels to pour? I'm not looking for a ""this is better, this is worse"". I'm happy with my kettle. I was just wondering how the two differ in terms of pour."
0,"A few questions about the 4:6 pour over method from someone who's never used Hi! I love filter coffee and I use the V60 and Aeropress quite a lot. With my pour overs I'm attempting to use something like the Hoffmann technique but I'm still figuring it all out as I'm not that experienced yet and I'm still trying to find the right way to do it. 
Recently, I found out about Tetsu Katsuya's 4:6 method which sounds really cool because it promises to give a lot of control. I haven't tried it yet but just from looking at the technique, I've got a few questions:

1) The the last couple of pours (60% of the water) is supposed to adjust strength. I've got somewhat of a terminology question: For me, 'strength' is about how much coffee to how much water. Based on the fact that, to control the ""strength"" in those pours, one increases or decreases the number of pours. From what I roughly know about how extraction may work, the increased number of pours increases the 'extraction', not the strength. Am I correct? So the 60% adjusts how extracted one wishes the coffee to be? (for example: a little less extraction for darker roasts or so)

2) How fast does one pour? From what I gather, one pours every 45 seconds and then lets it draw down until the next pour. But how fast does one pour? I reckon, pouring very fast will disrupt the bed too much and pouring too slow will not disrupt it enough and take too long. But is ""somewhere in the middle"" fine or does it make a huge difference?

3) How to find the correct grind size? With this method, one is supposed to have a lot of control over the extraction process, so I would reckon that the grind size is not the primary way of changing the flavor in the end. With how I'm used to do pour overs, I try to keep the brew technique itself quite consistent (apart from maybe agitating a little less or using colder water with darker roasts or something like that) and mainly change the extraction by changing the grind. I assume that with the 4:6 it's a bit different (?) Is it correct, that if the coffee reaches the bed just before the next pour, the grind size is correct or is it more complicated than that?

4) Is there a recommended minimum dose one should use for the technique to work correctly? In a video by European Coffee Trip they suggest to not use less than 18g for the Hoffmann method and say that the method may be more suitable for larger doses. How about the 4:6 method? 

That's all that comes to mind at the moment. Thanks a lot in advance!"
0,"V60: Difficulties with pouring speed I often brew a 15 to 250 V60 using (or trying to) the Hoffmann technique. My life has gotten a lot easier since I got one of the electric Hario kettles, which made pouring a lot easier. I still struggle though to have a consistent pour whilst not pouring too quickly. I know that it's mainly a problem of the small dose. Brewing a 30 to 500 is much easier but with the 15 to 250 I find myself struggling to poor at the correct speed without it stopping and not being consistent. I know that increasing the dose to 18g for example might help, but I find 250ml to be enough. I was wondering if anyone who has experience with making 15 to 250 (more less) V60s could help me in that regard. Is there some sort of technique that makes it easier? Does it just take time?

The cups have all been very good and consistent imo. However this morning I needed to make a larger batch (36 g coffee to 600 g water) so I swapped over the Chemex. And the coffee was like hot paper bag water, I could barely finish it. Should I buy some of the white Chemex filters, will that fix my problem?

0,"$2000 Espresso Setup Recommendations I'm looking for a grinder and an espresso machine with a peak budget of about $2000 USD.

For the grinder, convenience plays some role in pulling espresso shots, so features that are useful there would pull more weight than pure quality of espresso.  

For the machine, something in the semi-automatic range is what I'm imagining.  I've used a Gaggia Classic Pro and am comfortable with its controls.  If an E61 machine better fits the bill, I'm ok with that.

Use will be a couple of espressos a day and probably a daily milk drink.  While a double boiler probably wouldn't be needed, I think it would make making a couple of milk drinks back to back quicker.

0,"How Self-Cleaning Coffee Maker Works? | What are the Best Self-Cleaning Coffee Makers **The self-cleaning coffee maker** is just a regular coffee maker with an auto-clean feature**.**

Self-cleaning coffee makers give an indicator that there is a need for the self-cleaning cycle when scaling buildup inside the coffee maker reaches a certain level.

You have to run this self-cleaning cycle almost every month or two to ensure the proper working of the coffee maker.

You can easily clean the coffee maker by adding a **mixture of water and vinegar** to the coffee maker and then pressing the auto clean button.

This mixture then runs through the whole machine and removes any scaling and the remain of the coffee grounds. This cycle usually takes longer than a normal brewing cycle.

After this, add only freshwater to the coffee maker and run the normal brewing cycle without coffee; this will completely clean your coffee maker and make it ready for use.

This is a very useful feature that **protects your machine from any scaling buildup and improves the taste of your coffee.**

0,"Does a bad tamp really have a huge impact on espresso extraction rates? **Please let me know if this is the right place to post coffee help**

Equipment: 

- Breville Dual boiler (Used, Unknown maintenance history)
- Breville Smart Grinder Pro (New)

I've been having some trouble with my espresso shots. 

So far I've gotten a new grinder (Breville Smart Grinder Pro) and it still pulls over 100ml's on a ;20g dose of coffee at around 25-27 seconds. This is on the finest setting of 1-2 on the grinder, which seems weird as some forum users claim that anything under 10 can choke their espresso machine. I've also seen multiple videos of people pulling adequate shots of espresso on youtube using the same grinder. 

This makes me think the grind/grind consistency is not the issue (I try to distribute the grounds as evenly as I can, and also use a needle to get rid of some clumped grounds)

My tamp seems like is the default one that comes with the Breville Dual boiler, which seems like it doesn't fit the tamp *perfectly* but its less than a 1mm difference (I would say around 0.5mm?) It always leaves some ground coffee around the edges.

The only way I've achieved a shorter extraction is taking the dose to 22g and tamping **extremely** hard (like I'm leaning my body into it), and even then it was 80ml's out. The coffee also tastes very sour, which means.... under extraction....? 

So, as I have a new grinder I'm beginning to think that my problems lies in my tamping as I: 

- Do not have a tamping mat
- Tamp doesn't seem to fit the 58mm head that snugly

Could my shitty shots really be down to my crap tamping equipment/skills?"

My usual is 60 ml (by the measuring cup) to about 750 ml of water. 

But when I go to use the scale, it would come out to basically tell me I'm using 20 grams instead of 60. When I hit the unit conversion, it reads 20 grams or 20 ml, with no numerical change, just the unit readout.

0,"Timemore Black Mirror Drift Fix So I found a [post]( that seems to have helped with my Black Mirror. Before the weight reading would change with a static load (I'm calling that ""drift"") and the scale gave different readings in the region of ±1g to 2g depending on where the load was placed. I've only done the fix recently but it's helped a lot.

 Based off the post I think the white adhesive is the problem. My unit had quite a lot of adhesive on the load cell and the adhesive wasn't flat. OP also had a lot of adhesive and there's a comment on the post which is what I'm basing that theory off.

;""Mine didn't have this much adhesive on my load cell; but saying that i wasn't having any accuracy problems either""

I'll walk you through what I did to fix but know it's at your own risk.

Tools: Something sharp, plus shaped screwdriver, and an abrasive material.

  
To open the unit remove the circular stickers on the bottom. Some force is required to do this and the bottom material is soft so be aware you might scratch it. Remove the two screws underneath and you're in.

 removed the adhesive with with a nail file (I'm sure sandpaper would also work, the nearest Bunnings is a little way aways). It took about an hour of filing and checking to get it as flat as I had patience for (I might go back later). Be aware there are wires running underneath the adhesive so don't go too far down.

[The white adhesive is the silicone looking stuff on top.]( assemble and see what happens.

The end result for me is a scale that has a variance of ±0.1g and doesn't drift."

I'm looking for a drip coffee machine, but I'm a bit lost with all the different options. I'm also skeptical of the quality of the off-brands that Amazon is thrusting at me when I try to research this myself.

Requirements:

* Basic automation (fill with coffee/water at night, select a time for the next day, wake up to coffee)
* Reusable filter (unless this is a bad idea?)
* Decent keep-warm function, couple of hours would be great  


My budget is.. Lowest reasonable price while still getting a decent brew. Don't need bean-to-cup, I'm happy with coffee grounds. Might do my own grinding if I get into it enough.

I'm in the UK, and some of the popular US versions are unavailable or overpriced here.

However, I am having the opposite issue where sometimes a bean or couple of beans have not yet been ground but the machine still shuts down. Not a huge issue as pushing the button again grinds the remaining beans most of the time, but it is still mildly annoying.

0,"Caffeine every other day vs every 3 days Hello coffee users of reddit! This is my first post but I have been an avid coffee/tea/caffeine connoisseur for many years. I love the benefits of these substances and the psychoactive drug although unlike the polyphenols and antioxidants that have no diminishing returns, caffeine itself does. So scientists, coffee addicts, all that fine home in this subreddit; what is more optimal for getting the full benefits of caffeine and these wonderful brews:

Caffeine every other day or caffeine every 3 days?

I would assume that caffeine consumed every 3 days would be the most optimal for tolerance since at this point all half lives will have cleared along with another 24 hours to eliminate tolerance. Although, this might be too extreme and all the caffeinated beans and teas have other health benefits that would only be attained every 3 days. This leads me to wonder if every 2 days would be better as you can then drink more tea/coffee every 2 days than every 3 days. In this situations you might build an ever small tolerance but gain more benefits. I could suppose that for every 6-8 weeks of a every 2 day caffeine schedule, a 1 week break could be implemented to completely reset the brain. As most if not all tolerance clears on average in about 8 days for caffeine I believe (although if you have found different please tell).

It should be noted that I am implementing a hard 250mg caffeine limit and using mg scales to measure out my beans/teas before brewing and weighing out the coffee per ml to enable dosages that are as accurate as possible for a 180-220 mg dose approximation as beans and teas variation will require estimation. The dose will be fairly regular, I just need to determine frequency. I also plan to use healthy and sustainably decaffeinated teas/coffee on off days because the ritual is beloved.  What are everyone's thoughts on this? I would love to do a every other day schedule but I care about pushing for optimal brain health conditions more than furthering a habit I love. What has been the most ideal consumption strategy for caffeine that has led to maximum benefits and the least detriments for all of you?

I'm largely interested in making lattes, mochas and obviously espressos. 

Couple of questions from an amateur:

1) What is the best filter basket type to use for pre-ground coffee? 
2) What pre-ground coffee would you recommend? 

I am aware of that most hobbyists will say that I need a good quality finder and not use pre-ground, but at the moment just looking for some suggestions from you guys on the above. 

Cheers"

0,"New to the coffee world! - In the UK Naturally, wait for it, I'm about to offend everyone.... I HATE coffee. Lol  


However, I've just bought my girlfriend, who LOVES coffee, a very nice filter coffee machine as she was always doing coffee shops, or instant coffee. She made her first coffee yesterday from the machine and the smell was great - so I had to try it. It was actually very pleasant.

  
So I guess my question is, how do we go about entering the world of coffee and discovering what we like, without buying multiple expensive bags and not liking it? Wouldn't want to buy a 250g bag that makes say 15-20 coffees and only end up having one!

  
Is there anywhere we can buy a big box of different samples in the UK? Or does anywhere even do free samples? I get that theres such a wide variety of coffee, but figuring out whether we like light, medium, dark - or natural, wet or fermented process (I hope I'm getting those roasts and processes correct), would be a good start.  


If no to sample pack/box, maybe someone can shift us in the right direction. We're sinners here, currently enjoying milk and a sugar..... or two. However, we're keen to boot that and taste the coffee for what it really is, or at least reduce the amount of both, but it might take some getting used to. What I liked about the coffee I had yesterday, was how rounded it felt, it felt like I was actually tasting something rather than just the standard ""coffee"" taste. I also found that previously, instant coffee just tasted sharp, and too much, but even though the filter coffee was stronger, it just tasted thicker, less sharp, and more like a hot chocolate, without actually being thicker. If any of that makes sense!

  
My girlfriend is very keen on (plug your ears, you're about to be offended again) Starbucks caramel macchiato. She likes the sweet stuff, but I think she'll end up having 2 moods, as she really does enjoy a good quality rich coffee also.  


Sorry for rambling! Any advice appreciated."
0,A question for all coffee drinkers I’ve seen in movies a lot that people like to put sugar in their coffee. Does anyone on this sub do that?

0,"FIRST NFT COFFEE COMPANY Hey everyone of coffee reddit! I am looking at starting the first ever fully NFT coffee company and was wondering if there is even a market out there for it. 

I want to bring the future of NFT's to the coffee market. From what I have seen there are no coffee brands that are creating NFT's so that is what I want to do.

The basics of the brand are pretty simple. Buying coffee from us would be just like buying coffee online, the only difference is that every coffee bag is backed by an NFT. After every purchase of one of our NFT's we will send you your very own bag of our coffee. 

There will also be a few different buying tears: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The higher tear one buys, the better coffee they will be receiving. 

There will also be a monthly drop of 15 bags of the best quality and best tasting beans we can find. The drop will be different each month. 

With a project like this there are a lot of questions that arise of people wondering how they will get their coffee or how they will track their coffee. Our company has come up with a few answers to questions like these. Once the purchase of one of our NFT's is made you will be tasked with going to our website and filling out a form so we can send you your coffee right away. Also once you fill out this form we will instantly give you a tracking number for your bag of coffee. 

If one is looking to only trade our NFT's for a hopeful profit, as many NFT investors do. One will still be tasked with going to our website and filling out the form, on the form there will be a section for investors to select to not receive any coffee. 

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? Is there a market for it? Is it a good idea? What other questions do you have?"

0,"It's been 8 years since i've subscribed to a top-tier bean service for my Chemex, and local is all not reliable. What do you all recommend, lately? I haven't subscribed to a top tier beans service since before Tonx sold to Blue Bottle. I'm wary with my trust, since local bags rarely share roasted-on dates and even when they do the stores sell stale bags. I don't trust searching since everyone will say they are the best or great, but I remember the cups I made in 2013, and it was a magical time.

I live in the south-east and hope you all can recommend some killer services that reliably sell top tier beans ala what Tonx used to be like (they would send me beans they chose, following harvest cycles, and I just chose the frequency for them to send). If I had a preference if it mattered, I like light roasts that you swear tasted more like bitter tea and nothing like coffee you can find hot and ready anywhere locally.

I use a Chemex and a grinder, and am accustomed to dial in the cups per bag, if that helps."

0,"Delonghi Dedica EC685 Grouphead Issues Hi, I have a Delonghi Dedica EC685 and recently upgraded the steam wand with the Rancilio Silvia one. Since then, I've ran into a couple of issues and I wondered whether anyone in this community may be able to help?

**Water from grouphead continues to dispense**

The first issue is that after the standard shot of coffee is dispensed, a fine spray of water continues to pour out of the grouphead. It eventually stops, but creates a mess and shows something isn't performing as it should.

;#x200B;

**Steam coming from the Grouphead - as well as the steam wand**

When I use the steam wand, I can see that steam often comes from the grouphead too. This results in the steam wand often taking longer to build up pressure.

I replaced the steam wand myself, following a YouTube video and I thought I'd done everything correctly, but there's obviously something not quite right. Can anyone offer any advice of possible causes and solutions?  


I can't see anywhere near me (in UK) that can perform repairs on cheaper consumer units like the Delonghi Dedica. All of the repairers seem to focus on the commercial grade machines.

;#x200B;

I'm hoping I can fix it. It'll be a shame to have to discard it, or sell it for parts. I'm hopeful it's something I can fix myself, with some advice and guidance from this community.

Thanks,

0,"Trying to replace my wifes morning energy drink My wife has gotten into the habit of having one of those Bang energy drinks every morning either taking one from home or buying one at the vending machine at work. As far as the underlying reasons why she does so, she says its just the taste. She for sure gets enough sleep and eats well but I guess getting up at 5am everyday anyone would be groggy. Even her co-workers are worried about it as well as she puts it, ""they guilt trip me about them so much that I have to drink it before i get out of the car in the morning.""

Well we're big coffee enthusiasts enough so that we got a really nice espresso machine ( quick mill vetrano 2b evo), have a chemex for pour overs and buy gucci specialty beans whenever we have a good coffee at a nice coffee shop. When we have a coffee date she  enjoys purist espresso drinks and legit pour overs as she finds it fun to note special roast flavors. Like she knows her coffee. BUT thats not what she likes in the morning i guess?

I tried making her one of her nice pour overs, we have Gesha beans but i save those for other times. I think stuff like that is really reserved for her relaxing times where she can sit and think about the flavors shes experiencing. I woke up early with her and made her a pour over in our chemex the way we usually do and made her a 10oz serving. To be fair i served it in her 24 oz coffee mug and i guess it seemed small to her despite this being what we usually order when we get pour overs at a coffee shop. She just downed it like nothing noting she doesnt want to carry around her mug all day. Sounds like these morning rituals are about sugar? Or maybe shes just used to having a large drink in her hand she feels has weight to it lol. She likes to sip larger drinks as a morning habit? Regardless she still took her bang with her. When she gets home ima ask if she drank it right away during her commute or during her lunch.

What drink would you recommend I make her to drop the energy drinks over time? Should I just make her a larger pour over next time?

She liked it but maybe its like eating a nice steak or wine that you can savor during dinner but not in the morning as breakfast. I guess nobody really thinks about what they're eating in the morning and just need fuel? Running out of the house i guess isnt the best time for that specialty pour over. I was thinking maybe next time making her a ice coffee cuz its bigger but making an espresso drink in the morning rush sounds like an ordeal but im willing to try it.

0,"Need help finding discontinued replacement part for Krups Moka Brew (older F468 model) I somehow lost the lid for the water tank, part MS-1001510 (see pic). It's now discontinued and unavailable from Krups or any USA retailer I have found, and I also can't find any European retailer who will ship one to the USA.   

This is for the older, made-in-France version of the brewer, not the newer T8/KM468 version that uses a permanent filter. I am currently using the equivalent part from the more modern version as a temporary solution, but (1) its brushed instead of chromed, so it looks weird, and (2) more importantly, it is slightly bigger so it doesn't really fit the way it is supposed to. 

Anyone have any leads? I am happy to pay a reasonable price for one, if someone will just sell it to me!"

Anyways, the first time I tried it, it tasted interesting. I liked it in a way, but it also tasted bitter. I'm not sure why, I guess I didn't shake the bottle or something.

A few days later (Today) I had a glass for the morning, and I actually enjoyed it. I drank it black; It tasted like it has a subtle, flavored syrup that tastes like a hot fudge sundae. Although, it did seem kind of ""watery"" and less bitter. I didn't use any ice either.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the Stok not too sweet, but I feel like it could be better. It's certainly better than any of the straight up black coffee's I've tried, and it was a semi inexpensive way to try cold brew!"

0,"Beginner - Keurig -; Nespresso -; ?? Where to start? Hello coffee friends! 

In short, I've been researching for a week or so and now I'm looking to move more into the coffee world but I'd appreciate some help with information/suggestions!

**Experience**

I used to be a barista for about 5 years back in college so I have ""some"" knowledge. I had a not-so-great $100 delonghi espresso machine at the time that I barely used and haven't used in forever. I moved to a Keurig for convenience and used it for the past 5-7 years. Without doing any research at all, my wife and I impulse purchased a Nespresso VertuoPlus and wow... what a world of a difference in flavor!! With that being said, the variety completely sucks AND the cost of using these ridiculously overpriced pods daily is just silly.

**Concerns**

I've looked into V60, Aeropress, Moka pot, Clever Coffee Dripper and most of them come with the same concerns:

* Convenience - **I don't want whatever I buy to be too ""annoying""** because I will almost certainly end up not using it. My best example I can offer here I had a $20 blade grinder with a french press and a microwave. It was so much effort to make a cup of coffee that I basically never did.
* Taste - Assuming proper grinder, same beans, etc. I am failing to understand which method will generate the taste profile I'm after (because I do not know). I know I like the Nespresso Vertuo coffee pod taste - not sure if this maps directly to a type of brew method since they use their centrifuge type method?
* Minimal Gear - Ultimately, I'm just deciding to pursue this new hobby. I don't really have a direct budget in mind but will be looking to purchase an espresso set up in the near future as well. To get started, is this all I need? 
   * Brewing method device (eg. AP, V60, etc)
   * Gooseneck kettle
   * Grinder

**Suggestions I'm After**

So, the things I'm hoping to get out of this post - 

* Which method would I enjoy the most or should I start with?
   * I'm also wondering if a manual method like this is the way to go or a nicer brewer such as the Technivorm 59691? How do they differ (besides control)?
* Recommendations on specific kettles? The wiki only shows 1, are their better alternatives?
* I'm assuming since I plan to go espresso soon going a nicer conical burr grinder is the way to go. Is the Baratze Encore good enough? Should I up it to Baratze Sette 30 or 270? What about the Fellow Ode (I really like the stylistic look of this one)

;#x200B;

TL;DR - Moved from Keurig to Nespresso and ready for next step."

I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my coffee, however I feel like there’s quite a bit to be desired. Especially when I buy coffee from my favourite coffee shop on the go or even McDonald’s, it tastes so much better than what I make at home. 

I’ve also been working in a new job that requires me to leave home early and return late. I learned my lesson brewing some French press one morning and putting it into my thermos.

It’s easy and seems affordable, but at $2 that price could add up to a lot over the course of a year.

0,"[QUESTION] Increasing strength of pour-over brew Hi all, 


My usual coffee is made on a Flair signature, an is an iced Americano with these ratios :


2oz espresso
4oz water
2oz milk


This produces a tasty, high quality, and strong drink. I was recently gifted a V60 and pouring kettle and was looking to get into it for light roast coffee vs the medium-dark of espresso. However, when I tried brewing coffee in the V60 (using both the James Hoffmann and 4:6 methods), the result was a tasty brew (not too acidic or bitter), but one that tasted like a good coffee that was heavily watered down. It tasted incredibly weak, and nowhere near what I'm used to. 


My question is, how can I make the V60 brew closer to the strength of my typical Americano ? I tried adjusting water/coffee ratio and number of pours in the 4:6 method, but the results were only a percentage of what I'm looking for. 


Any tips ? Thanks for your time."
0,"French press doesn’t get any bitterness I’ve been drinking coffee for years, but just for the wake up initially. My parents always had a drip machine at home with whatever they had from Costco in the pantry (like one grade up from Folgers…).

Anyways, a few years ago I moved to Japan, and there were no drip machines anywhere, just single serving droppers like V60s. I also got myself an Aeropress and enjoyed those since I was the only coffee drinker at home.

Cue to my wife accidentally throwing away the Aeropress filter cap a few weeks ago thinking it was an old cockroach trap, and I decided to get a moka pot. I didn’t expect this, but my wife loves the coffee it makes, so I was making twice the coffee as before, and looking for a faster way to fill my 500 ml mug for work, so I decided to get a 1 liter stainless steel French Press.

I watched the James Hoffman ultimate French Press video, and gave it a try. I did the original 5 minute soak, a swirl and some scooping, 9 minutes waiting, put the plunger to the top of the water, and served, to enjoy the most bland cup I’ve ever had.

 I tried again and again with different grind sizes on the Timemore C2 from 24 clicks all the way down to 11, and all I get is a bland bean taste. It has no bitterness, no sourness, just a big general bean taste. I even tried fully plunging a few times, and I can’t get anything that feels like coffee.

Pros:
# Doesn't use too much sugar (1~2 tbs)
# Has that experimental unique taste (which can be also a con... depends on one's taste)

Cons:
# Doesn't taste too much like coffee in my opinion
# Somewhat of an intense (not coffee) burnt taste implying this experiment's name
# Can use allot of coffee tbs (I used 3)

So, the burnt man. This is indeed a special one, it could be made for those holidays which are not meant to be celebrated, drink it as to 'feel like I got burnt'.
# The burnt taste itself is not that intense to be undrinkable by the way.

Ings:
2 bottle caps of milk
3~5 tbs coffee grind
2 tbs sugar

What have I done this time?
I boiled water, about 1\6th worth of the brew pot I have and added sugar as they boiled, added one tbs of taster choice's coffee and one bottle cap of normal milk to the water, boiled them both up good for around I'd say like 10 seconds or so. enough time for the sugar to start caramelize. Lowering the fire I took a cup, placed one more coffee tbs to it, filled it with hot water to about 1\3rd of the cup (small cup) and another milk bottle cap.
After it I added the brew from the pot to the cup, tasted, and added another coffee tbs to the top of the cup and slowly stired. Done.

0,"Some questions about my cold brew extraction Hey guys!

I’m relatively new to a lot of cold brew stuff but I wanted to get some advice as I’m a little confused.

I feel like every time I try to make cold brew, the taste of my coffee leaves a very dry taste in my mouth regardless of the bean I am using.

I have been pondering on this and I have some ideas, though I don’t know how I’m going to resolve them.

1) My water contains too many minerals. To the best of my knowledge and college level chemistry, my understanding is that the minerals are what are mostly contributing to the extraction process. I live on a well water system that admittedly probably isn’t as regulated as it should be so it’s possible that my water is causing the extraction to procede to quick, thus leading to an over-extraction. I should also note that within 15 minutes of introducing my cold brew bag to the water, it is already pretty much at a “ready-to-drink” color (how I’d describe it)

2) Am I just messing up the ratio? I’ve only ever been taught to do 4 oz coffee : 64 oz water, which I don’t necessarily know how that turns out in the long run. Is there a better ratio I should be using? I’ve seen things like 1:8 and 1:10 or even sometimes 1:5, but is that using ounces? grams? does it matter? 

I guess my biggest question is as follows: do you think that a large concentration of minerals in my water would greatly affect the taste and overall quality of my cold brew? And to follow up, what would be my best option? I’ve heard of Third Wave Water and I’ve also heard of people making their own concoctions using epsom salt and whatnot. Do you think it has more to do with my ratio? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I’ve put my setup and rough procedure down below as well.

0,"Gaggia Classic Pro 1st day.. dumb mistake. So it's Christmas morning and I just set up the machine .. watched Tons of online videos... And the 1st few pulls were God-awful.. More online videos more tweaking more fiddling... Let the machine preheat 20 minutes and still same result... using pre ground Pilon from Publix.. no scale. Everything default that comes with the unit. .. shots are watery and taste awful. 

(Before this I used a Mr. Coffee espresso and used a Lavazza commercial unit for milk frothing. Hey its what I got..)

I check again and discover that I was using the large pro basket instead of the correct one which is the pressure basket with a smaller center cluster of holes.. 

Pulled a shot with a stopwatch and probably stopped it to soon but the shot now looked amazing with a rich color and creme.  

Made a latte with some lousy art ""noob"".. took a sip and it was on par if not better than some of the coffee I have had in upscale European Restaurants after a meal.

Total noob. Basic tools. Plastic included tamper.. Store bought pre ground not particularly fresh espresso.. Gaggia Classic Pro on day one. Damn, damn good. Added maybe a teaspoon of sugar like I would of at a restaurant.. 

Thank you for the advice from everyone here and I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas/ Holiday season!"

I’m an avid coffee drinker. I don’t drink a ton in volume, but I’m very particular about the cup or two I do drink every day. My everyday, forever, has been La Colombe Corsica (drip) or Nizza (cold brew). I’m also a sucker for lightly sweetened/flavored lattes, often from Starbucks for convenience. 

I received a Nespresso Verturo for Xmas. We all know Keurig is disgusting, but I longed for the convenience, and have heard many good things about Nespresso. I’ve found some blends I like, and I’ve been using it. The thing I’ve realized though is that EVERY time I drink Nespresso coffee, my stomach freaks out. I’ve brushed it off as empty stomach, something I ate, “isolated incident,” but it’s now occurred to me that it’s really every time I drink it, even after just a sip or two. 

I do have a long history of reflux, which I’m not awesome at always taking my meds for- but it’s been markedly worse since the New Year… aka when I started using my new machine. 

I’m curious, has anyone else experienced this?? I’ve long been a drinker of some strong coffee, but this has never been a thing, until now."

I was wondering if there's any way to confirm if I got the 1.1 burrs or if I got the original ones without disassembling the grinder? I just got my Ode and I feel like the coffee feels terribly underextracted and there are lots of large bits even at finer settings (2, since manual said to avoid 1 for the first 10lb of coffee).

I bought the grinder from a large Danish retailer and I was thinking that they might have stocked these before the 1.1 burrs were released... Is there some SKU difference or so that I can use to confirm?

Or does anyone have any tips for the Ode? Should I try calibrating it? So far I feel like I was getting better and more consistent results out of my 39€ Melitta Molina which doesn't seem right to me.. What am I doing wrong?

I use an aeropress for the brewing and follow the same recipe as I've done before with either 12g coffee to 200g water (Hoffmann's recipe) or 20g coffee to 230g water when I want something a bit stronger. Both turn out poorly with the 12g one almost tasting like a bland tea-like drink."

0,"New to home espresso, need help Hi all, I'm going to make this as to the point as possible but overall, I need help.  

I bought: ([Mr. Coffee Automatic Dual Shot Espresso/Cappuccino System]( to me (a newb) I thought it was a good option for a first espresso machine.  It comes with a pressurized portafilter basket and it says 15 bars of pressure.  

I used: ([Starbucks Pre-Ground Dark Espresso Roast]( from my grocery store. I've realized since buying that it is for drip coffee and is not ground finely enough for espresso.  

At the moment, the suggested dose is 14-16g of coffee for a double shot (what I make the most and what I experimented with for this).  I used 16 grams of coffee, brewed for 20 seconds and got around 75g of liquid in the cup.  It tasted like bitter water to I'm sure no-one's surprise.

Obvious thing would be to get an actual grind size fit for espresso.  Well, during my research on an appropriate pre-ground option/grinder I came across from a few places that since I'm using a pressurized basket (the one with a single hole at the bottom is the one I have in case I'm screwing up the terminology) the grind size matters less, and that if I get a fine grind the shot will choke and barely any liquid will come out resulting in equally nasty espresso.   

My main question is:  Is this true?  Or am I good to go to get a finer grind?  Another obvious answer would be to get a grinder and experiment.  However, I'm a grad student and I don't have a ton of cash to throw at a grinder.  I bought the $100 machine I mentioned earlier because I figured that was an investment and I would save money rather than buying coffee on campus all the time for like $5 a pop.   I really don't want to invest in a grinder and then find out that the ground coffee I have at the moment is as good as its gonna get due to my machine, but I also don't want to buy one for $30 and it not be able to get a grind fine enough that I need.  Anyway, this has gone on way too long as it is and I'm not sure that anyone will be able to understand what I'm saying but if you are and can offer any actual advice on the situation I would greatly appreciate it.  At the moment I'm stuck and not sure what to do to get a better result from my machine/setup.  If there are any preground options that anyone could recommend or a very budget grinder (like sub-$50 I know thats like too cheap but its what I've got to work with) I would appreciate it and yeah."

0,"Help! Coffee Doesn’t Make Sense Anymore So I’ve been brewing my morning Chemex pot for the last couple of years and I have had it down to a science to make a great brew every time. Problem is I’ve been using a shitty blade grinder and an analog thermometer kettle and not measuring my ratios at all. 

I was very excited when I got a burr grinder and a scale for Christmas from my in-laws. I can finally start making the *perfect* cup. Problem is- now that I measure everything out, try to get my temperature to 205-200 on my kettle, I realize that I’ve been making my morning joe the last two years with a ratio of 25-30:1, Usually about 35-45g/L. 

I have maxed out the course setting on my burr grinder, tried to brew as fast as I possibly can, get my temp right, but no matter what using a 16:1 or even 17-18:1 ratio now that I’m 2 weeks in every batch I make turns out to taste like that crazy strong nasty diner coffee with no taste notes that just punches you right in the mouth. Wayyy too strong. 

The thing is I know that I am not just used to drinking weak coffee because I always enjoy a specialty drink when I visit coffee shops and I feel like I’ve been able to get my coffee to taste like that even with my shitty backwards process I’d made up over the last couple years. 

I suspect that maybe my kettle thermometer  is like way wrong and I’ve been brewing hot and over extracting all this time, but it is just blowing my mind that I’ve made it work this whole time."

I am getting similar results with all 3. In the Chemex I had been brewing at a 9.1 using the OXO and have tried anywhere from a 3 to an 8 on the Ode. Everything seems to be bitter and leaves a bad dry taste in my mouth that lingers, even on 8. I am using the same variables when brewing except for grinder. I also tried Third Wave water for a few of the brews, same result.

I'm new to pour-overs (typically do espresso or tea) and am using a Kalita Wave 155 with a Eureka Mignon Crono, as well as scale/timer, etc. Using local, third wave, single-source coffee, freshly ground.

I can't take a lot of caffeine at once and I like a 6 oz cup, which doing a 1:15 ratio is 10g coffee to 150g water (about 5 to 5.5oz ends up in the cup but that works for me).

I had a pretty coarse/uneven grind going, but I was tasting good notes with little sourness until the coffee sat and cooled more. I dialed in the grind to be closer to sea salt without clogging the filter. To my surprise, the coffee is very sour. 

Again, as I'm new, I have a couple of questions. 1) Is this recipe too small, causing an effective unlerextraction despite having a finer grind?

2) I still finish my pours in 2:45 to 3 minutes. Does the timing/amount per pour really affect the extraction this much, and if so, would it cause underextraction/sour like this?

My ultimate question is can I do this without the coffee going bad/poisoning myself?

0,"Deciding between Flair 58 and modifying a Gaggia Classic Pro with PID and OPV. I’m trying to decide between these two espresso makers and am leaning towards the flair for a few reasons:
- Easy to clean and maintain
- Less time modding 
- Pre-infusion and pressure profiling 

The pros for the Gaggia are milk steaming (not essential for me), and less physical (again not essential). And it’s a decent entry espresso machine.

This will be my first espresso machine. I have a Comandante C40 grinder and an aeropress and looking for the next step in my new hobby.

0,"Clogging during drawdown, only with a specific brand of beans ; regardless of grind. I’ve been trying out a local company, Stamp Act Coffee and run into the same issues with their beans specifically. I’ve tried grinding medium fine, medium, even medium-coarse for V60 and Moccamaster brews. 

I typically bloom double the weight of my beans for 60 seconds, then go ahead and make my coffee. I’ve tried using a flour filter to remove fines which failed. I’ve messed with grind size which failed as well. Water seems to filter through fine until I stop pouring, then it stagnates. The result is a burnt, bitter tasting cup.

I’m no expert, but fairly competent at dialing in my V60 and moccamaster grind to draw down at an even, measured rate. It seems to just be these beans. I have very good, soft water at home. All my equipment, filters included seem fine with other beans.

Grind seems to be unaffected… but still I’m not sure if I ruined it. 

Also, when I see YouTube videos about handgrinders people just tap the handle and it spins freely. There seems to be some drag in the bearings of mine. If I just tap it the handle only makes it a quarter turn. Not the free spinning thing you see in videos.

0,"Could there be any reason for the same coffee tasting better in the afternoon? For the past few days, I've been making a simple 1:1 coffee-to-milk drink both in the morning for breakfast and in the afternoon. (I'm using instant coffee at the moment but I think it should be fine!) And somehow, even with the same recipe, the afternoon cup just tastes a lot better, compared to the breakfast cup, which tastes somewhat flavorless and watery. 

Granted, I do make a slightly scaled up version of the drink for breakfast (with slightly more coffee of course), being in a 12 oz cup rather than a 10 oz cup I use in the afternoon. But I also did remember making the same 10 oz cup for breakfast some days ago, and it still didn't taste as good. (The afternoon cup I drank yesterday was pretty much room temperature, and it still tasted better than the one I had today xD)

My guess it has something to do with ""palate"", I think? The coffee being the first food/drink I taste in the day (sometimes even before the breakfast itself- although I did take care to drink water beforehand) maybe affects my perception of it. I don't know, really- I would like to hear of any helpful or interesting ideas others might have. Thank you, and have a good one!"
0,"Need some help + clarification Got a Breville Barista Pro recently and so far here are some things I need help and clarification on:

;#x200B;

\- In terms of Espresso and Doppio, is it 7-9g for Espresso (single shot) and 14-18g for Doppio (Double-Shot)

\- 7g of grinded beans = 30mL liquid and 14g of grinded beans = 60mL liquid

\- Coffee extraction should start from 5-7 seconds after the button is pressed

\- When people say coffee pour for 25-30 seconds, do they mean when the extraction starts or as a total (is it 25-30 seconds + the 5-7 seconds extraction or just 25-30 seconds total)

\- The perfect Espresso shot would be e.g (I might be wrong) 7g of beans + perfect grind pulls 30mL of liquid in 25-30 seconds or 25-30 seconds + 5-7 seconds

\- When tamping, how do I know if I am applying too much or too little force? 

\- The Breville Barista Pro Portafilter has a detachable portafilter double spout which from what I have read online is used to make two shots of coffee at once. However, if I take it off to do a single shot, there is a small screw bump preventing me from tamping evenly. How do I fix this issue? (I have a tamping mat as well) (I can respond in comments for further clarfication)

;#x200B;

I've done research online and I know how to find the perfect grind. I am mainly confused by the timing and how much liquid is extracted, and how much coffee to grind and tamping as well with the Breville Barista Pro Portafilter and whether I should use the spout included or not."
0,"New to espresso, need grinder suggestions Hi all,

Here's my (hi)story.

I've been making filter (V60 and Chemex) for a while, and while I have an espresso machine (Delohngi Dedica) I really only use it to make Lattes and never for straight espresso. I don't find it capable enough for that.

For my grinder: when I first got into making coffee, I used a Baratza Encore. When that died, I decided to go the high quality manual grider route, and splurged on an 1ZPresso K-Plus. Its a great grinder for the few times a week I make filter coffee and espresso for Lattes.

But recently I've gotten the itch to try my hand at making an espresso I can enjoy, and so I decided to get myself a Flair 58 (scheduled to arrive in January). I know that I'm going to have to work to dial in my shots, and so I wanted something to replace my manual grinder because doing multiple espresso shots using a manual grinder can be tough. (So I've heard). 

Right when I was ordering my Flair 58, I noticed that the Niche Zero was in stock and also scheduled to ship in January. I'd alway wanted one, but for the high price tag and me not really needing a top quality espresso grinder, I was never really tempted to pull the trigger on one. But now I was. So I ordered it.

But after ordering it, I started to have second thoughts, because its not really responsible for me to spend over $730 (after adjusting for exchange rate) on a grinder (in addition to the almost $600 I spent on the Flair 58), and so with a heavy heart I cancelled my order. 

But now I need suggestions for a grinder that can fit within my budget, and can make good espresso and filter (primarily V60 and Chemex) coffee. If its only geared towards espresso, thats also OK, because I can still use my K-Plus for filter.

0,"A guide to hipster millennial douchebag coffee flavor notes Just got a brand new bag of that sweet Onyx coffee, or Pete's Roast, or whatever roaster is nearest you? Does it promise ""floral"" ""juicy"" ""silky"" ""elderberry"" ""nectarine"" or other douchebag flavors? If it does, you may be like me, wondering why it makes these empty promises that don't deliver on a standard cup of black homebrew made from an Aeropress, following their recipe to the T.

The key, my friends, is Cold Brew.

If you want to taste every single note they put on their bag, you need to cold brew it. Hot brew won't do. Doesn't matter the temperature, grind size, grind quality, or anything else. Your Aeropress with a consistent recipe will always make the same-ish flavor batch of single press brew. You may notice a slight difference in notes between one or two bags.

But the real key to noticing all the douchebag notes lies in cold brew. Grind medium fine, and use a 1:5 coffee:water ratio. Better yet, do 1:4. Anyone that promises higher is a lier. You need a solid, creamy cup of cold brew to get all the notes of ""anus"" and ""wet cigarette."""

I'm interested if anyone has had success with the new-ish formulation of ""Light Roast"" filters from Cafec. Their former light roast filters received much praise, and I personally liked using them.

Some time last year they changed their paper, and began labeling them T-92. These new light roast filters are surprisingly slow, or at least are much slower than is fashionable here in our subreddit. (I get around 5 minutes for 200g water, in my typical v-60 grind size.)

Here's mine with a little back story (It's for people that use a hand grinder and like to read; otherwise the process could be even more miserable): I was very happy when I upgraded to the Comandante last year; it was simple to use, had a great community of people who helped with suggestions, cleared up space on my counter, and provided delicious coffee with nice clarity and sweetness. 

So fast forward a year and I've grown to hate hand grinding. What was once cool and meditative has turned into an annoying chore. So I've been looking for a single dose electric grinder which hasn't been easy. (long wait lists, indecision, etc) I became a little desperate and even looked at super expensive grinders before I came back to reality. (I just brew filter coffee)

Here's my tip that has solved my problem- I read something interesting on an iPad while grinding. The 35 or so seconds went by in a flash and has changed my perspective on hand grinding. (I mindlessly turned the handle while grinding up the beans, and even enjoyed the process) This will especially be helpful when I grind 60 grams for cold brew.

Lots of people love ""funky"" tasting coffee and it seems like experimental processes expand even on what certain Naturals can provide. But I don't believe that's all the processes are good for. For example, Manhattan Coffee Roasters has coffee from Finca El Paraiso on their site  described as ""thermal shock anaerobic and double fermentation thermal shock"" and their coffee has been described to me as ""not boozy/fermenty, but tasting like super clean/sweet naturals"".

- minimal digital controls (timer isnt even necessary)

- simple to use and maintain

- somewhat long lasting

- at least 8 cup size (drinks two mugs in the morning)

- Bonavita 8 Cup - poor reliability, coffee spills while brewing

- Ninja Programmable Brewer - poor reliability, leaky brew pause feature, ill fitting carafe lid

- Mocamaster one cup - apparently the cheaper model is not built as well, clogs often, and my dad would probably shit himself if i spent nearly $400 on the larger model

0,"Sour coffee with layer of fines on top of filter bed  bought a bag of “preground for filter” medium roast coffee from a reputable roaster (roasted 30/12/21), and when brewing with a v60 and clever dripper (all I’ve tried so far) it tastes relatively weak with a strong sour aftertaste. I’ve only experienced this flavour in coffee once before, with a cheap bag of decaf that was in a family members cupboard for about a year (I was desperate, ok?). It too had the same layer on top of the bed that you can see in the images. There was very little bloom at all, and the water seemed to take a while to soak into the grounds with the clever dripper even with continuous swirling, with the mix starting very wet with some dry pockets taking a long time to wet at all. I had to use a teaspoon to stir the second time because the water (fresh off the boil) wasn’t wetting the grounds well at all. I’ve never experienced this, other than one time I forgot to boil the kettle and poured cold water into my aeropress. I normally buy dark roast beans from the supermarket and grind using a cheap hand grinder, but I figured I would try preground from a reputable roaster. It’s definitely not espresso fine, it really just looks normal. Maybe very slightly finer than supermarket ground coffee, but not by much.

0,"How to break my Starbucks addiction with something other than a Kuerig? I want to start making more coffee at home instead of spending $5 a day at Starbucks, the reason I go there is that it seems there coffee has a lot more ""pep"" to it than stuff made with a Kuerig, it is my understanding that these machines don't make strong coffee due to the water temp and contact time.

I've looked at some nicer machines, but they all seem to make an entire pot of coffee. I don't drink more than one cup, and don't see much in the way of single brew machines, other than Kuerig.

I've looked at espresso makers, but espresso machines take a lot of skill from my understanding unless you spend a ton on a semi or automatic machine. The nespreso machines..the pods seem pricey, so not really saving much there. 

So do they make a single serve machine that actually makes stronger coffee? 

Also..I know grinding makes coffee ""more fresh"", but does fresh ground have more caffeine to it, or does that not change after time like aromatics do?

Yes, I know starbucks uses like a $15,000 coffee machine, but surely there is a way to get more bang for your buck on the level of energy from a cup."

Every morning for the past 3 years, I’ve fired up my Bodum electric gooseneck kettle, ground my coffee (using an OXO conical burr grinder), wet the filter for my Hario V60, weigh out 22 grams, and do the James Hoffman pour-over method using a clock and scale. 

But I recently stayed at a place that had a $20 Mr. Coffee maker with those flat-bottom pleated filters. Had a very early start in the AM so the night before I ground my usual coffee (brought it with me), programmed the machine to brew, poured the water in, and went to sleep. (I did however use a scale with the same ratio of coffee and water as I use for a single cup, only doubled). 

Woke up to the sounds of Mr. Coffee doing his brew-burps. But I have to say, the cup of coffee it produced was…excellent.

For the past six months, I have not been able to make a single good cup. Everything comes out tasting bitter, over-extracted, burnt. No variables have changed to my knowledge. I use either a Baratza Encore or Porlex Tall (JP30). I've inspected both (burr holders are fine, burrs are fine, etc.). I've also thoroughly cleaned both. Same result. I use tap water (which, by itself, tastes fine to me).

I tend to go for light, bright coffees. I've been using Counter Culture Apollo, various Happy Mug Ethiopians, and Good Citizen Chin Up (all no more than 2 weeks past roast date). Nothing tastes like it does in the coffee shop (and I use to be able to achieve close to that). I'm tired at this point of wasting money on good beans that I can't make into good coffee. Here, for example, is my recipe for an Aeropress (inverted method):

* 18g coffee
* grind at 18 on Encore (calibration screw set to middle of fine) OR grind at 5 clicks on Porlex
* pour 100g water 30 secs off boil
* bloom, stir (both take total of 15secs) 
* pour remaining 100g water, stir, and steep for 1:45

I am convinced, by others and by my own experience, that over-extraction in immersion brews is a myth that causes some people to chronically produce under-developed brews. I think that many recipes for French press and Aeropress are convoluted, over complicated products of our hyped up coffee culture. I hope for a bunch of you guys to brew along with me and educate yourself, with your own equipment, about what works and what doesn’t. I believe you will surprise yourself with how simple it is to make great coffee at home. 

[Here is a link to a post I made from a couple weeks ago about all of this. It is required reading for this group project. If you participated in the discussion there, thank you. You’ve change my life for the better.]( TLDR: you can’t over-extract an immersion brew because science and dramatically long brew times can make some of the best cups of coffee people have ever had. 

Here’s what you can do if you want to play along: 

1. Read for a bit in the link above. The main post and especially some of the top replies. It will help you understand the situation and what we are trying to accomplish here. 

2. Brew an immersion brew of your own and TRY to over-extract it. It can be an Aeropress, a French press, cowboy coffee, or whatever else you want. It just has to be immersion and you have to go finer than you normally would, hotter than you normally would, and dramatically longer than you normally would. 

3. Report here what you did in detail, with what beans, what roast level, and how it tastes compared to your normal brew for that method. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. 

Then we can all nerd out together over the data. 

Ready… 

GO!!!"

The common test tubes on the market hold about 20g of beans.

0,"Pausing my espresso shot after pre-infusion So I got a bambino plus over the holidays and I also got some pre-ground beans with it. The beans were supposedly ground for espresso but I found that even when I put as much coffee into the basket (20 grams) and tamp as hard as I dare (30-40 lbs maybe) I still get too high of a ratio before I get a good tasting shot. For example if I stop the shot after 25-30 seconds it will be at about 60 grams out. I'm fine with this sometimes but other times I'd like a 1:2 or less ratio. So to get this I tried something that made sense to me but I can't find any info about online. Basically I pre-infuse my shot for 8 seconds, stop the shot, wait 10 seconds, pre-infuse again for 8 seconds but this time let the machine turn the full pump on and actually pull the shot for another 15 seconds. This puts me at about 36 grams out at 40 seconds. This tastes much better to me than if I had stopped the shot at 36 grams during a regular pull (probably would be around 20 seconds).

Does anyone know if this is something other people have tried and/or documented? Is there anything I might be doing to my shot unintentionally by doing this?

0,"My amateur opinion of the Onyx advent calendar I've spent the pandemic making better coffee. I bought a Chemex and a Virtuoso+ grinder. I order coffee beans from a variety of roasters. (Currently Ruby Roasters are my favorite.) When ordering coffee, I usually look at the tasty notes, because I know which flavors I like. But I didn't pay too much attention to processing or where the beans were harvested. So my motivation for trying the Onyx advent calendar was to get a crash course of a variety of coffees to try to narrow down my preferences. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. I got to compare and contrast lots of different coffees over the course of (a little less than) a month. But I probably won't do it again (at least from Onyx) next year.

First off, although Onyx promises fresh beans because they're nitrogen-packed, I found this to not be entirely true or consistent. Some packs tasted a bit stale. Could be because I wasn't ""dialing in"" each batch, or maybe the nitrogen packing just doesn't work for all beans. The bloom on some was definitely more like what I'd expect from coffee beans that had been sitting around for a while. 

Second, they provide 56g of coffee, enough for a 900g Chemex brew. I typically brew 500g, and some days I would brew a 400g pot in the afternoon, but right now I have a bunch of half-packs of coffee beans that I'm not sure what to do with. I might cold brew them to see what comes out. But overall, it's too much coffee for me.

Finally, it's a lot to pay for coffee. I'm used to spending $50-60 per month for coffee, so $175 was a stretch. On top of that, I have a bunch left over. 

So in the end, I like the concept. I experienced a lot of coffees I probably would never have ordered myself, and it helped me figure out my preferences by allowing me to sample a bunch of coffees back to back. But the price is too high, and I think they include too much coffee. If they let you choose smaller packs for a lower price, or threw in a gift like a mug, I might consider it again. But December 2022 I'll likely be seeking something else."

Do I do a chemex with a stagg ekg kettle or do I do a quality drip machine, maybe the bonavita? I really love tasting all of the notes and have never been able to achieve that when I used to do pour overs at home (granted I was having the coffee pre-ground at the shop and probably didnt have right h20 temp). One of the best coffees I've ever had was a drip from Analog in Seattle - it legitimately tasted like a slice of birthday cake. So this got me thinking about maybe doing drip. 

In any case, would be curious of what you all think! Thanks."
0,"Yet another semi-automatic post; one button to one cup I´m making about 4-8 cups og Kalita coffee a day, with freshly grinded beans from my Wilfa Svart grinder. However, I'm soon to be a dad and the while the brewing process is therapy in it self, I'd really like a coffee machine that allowed me to brew one cup with freshly grinded beans without having me preparing any filters or anything. I have no need for milk steamers or espressos. Just plane filter coffee, but without the job of preparing the filters and so on. 

And yes, taste is important - and I usually cant stand the automatics at work (but I´m betting that the beans are low quality beans there). Without sounding like a douche; Price is not an issue.

0,"Coffee/toffee/chocolate taste notes I'll try to be brief.

I'm new to grinding/brewing coffee other than throwing grocery store grinds in a cheap Black and Decker flat bottom drip. My go-to is Peet's Alma de la Tierra dark coffee. I use two tablespoons to 12oz water and it works for me. I have two of those a day, then 2-3 decafs.

I never go to Starbucks. Never liked it. Mostly, I rarely buy coffee in a retail place but several months back I was on travel and stopped in a fancy little coffee shop that was doing pour overs. The blend was smooth as silk (I hate acid) and tasted of caramels/toffee. I downed it and asked to try something else. Asked if I liked chocolate, the gal smiled when I said 'yes' and brewed up another pour over. My God I was in heaven. Chocolate notes in coffee???

Anyhow, my quest began. I bought the equipment. I have purchased and discarded too many bags of beans to count (my daughter in law takes all my rejects and says they are ""fine"". Whatever.).

I now have a Hario V60 pour over kit, scale and kettle. I also brew single cups (12oz) when I'm in a hurry in a nice Bonavita model BV1900TS.  I've tried many different online blends (whole bean) that I grind in an OXO burr grinder. It has 15 settings where 5.5 is roughly medium fine, 8 is medium, etc.

The BEST cup I've brewed was Coffee Bros Dark Blend, for well, dark blend coffee, and BeanBox Johnson House Blend, for a medium coffee. About 20% of the time I nail it with either blend in pour over (never in drip, it just sucks). I've tried everywhere from 20-30g beans per 12 oz, grinds from medium fine to medium coarse...it's just all over the place. I can't get consistent no matter what I do.

Is there such a fine art to this that it will be years before I get this right? I'm tired of spending all this money on coffee I'm just throwing out after one god awful sip.

Sorry to vent. I guess that wasn't so brief."

0,"Technivorm moccamaster + breville smart grinder pro settings, really challenging. Hello fellow bean lovers. I recently got a technivorm moccamaster, very exciting. Newest model, great sale etc. I was excited to upgrade my grinder as well. I had been use a cheaper table top burr grinder set to medium coarse and weighing beans.

So, weighing 70grams of beans is the right amount for 10 (moccamaster cups not US cups) to be specific in the guide they suggest 69 grams.

I was making really nice coffee, getting some great flavors. Then I got the breville smart grinder pro. This for some reason let’s you adjust and pull by all sorts of standards. Except grams. Which is the only thing we really need. They give the option to use cups, but they are referencing American cups and not the same used for moccamaster. So I can just set it to 10 cups moccamaster = 10 cups breville grinder. Seems dumb, I know. So I’ve spent about a month guessing and making a pot each day trying to adjust and guess, even wasting a ton of coffee grinding and timing for 70grams, etc. but honestly I’m pretty much a day away from returning the grinder. 

I’ve put in a lot of time but the coffee comes out so black that I can barely handle it. I’m dialed currently at 48coarse for 10cups and for some reason they let me adjust how long that takes, I don’t really know why. I want the measurement to be the measurement.

Let me tell give you a little bit of backstory. I try to make frappes like two times a month, when the dissapointment of the previous one wears off. I prep the ice all day (small freezer), make a whole lotta mess and get big fat nothing out of it. 

And today, the dissapointment is extremely bitter, because the frappe was GOOD. Right amount of espresso, milk, caramel flavor, proper sweetness...but once again, it was just thick and foamy, almost as if all the ice cubes weren't even there when I blended it. Once again, the dream of perfect cold frappe texture is gone. 

The drink is currently chillin in the freezer waiting for the second blending attempt, I made myself dissapointing americano instead and I am thinking about what I could have done wrong. I watched so many baristas videos about how they prepare it, and I think I didn't make mistake. 

Did I blend it for too long? Too much ice? Too little ice? Not chilled enoug h? 

Does anyone also struggle with achieving that perfcet texture?"

0,"Different grind size ratios Are there any “standards” on how precise a grind size coming out of a grinder should be? For pour overs or espressos.

From my understanding so far people usually aim for more fines in their espressos (still haven’t looked into why) and people like clearer coffees for pour overs by having a more precise grind size without extra fines and course grinds?
Though I also hear that being too precise, maybe by using a sifter, and getting rid of extra fine fines or bigger/course grinds can make a coffee less complex.

I’m assuming most of this can be biased and very personal but are there any standards for what someone should aim for?

Can sifting be good for cupping?"

So, the kalita wave has been my daily brewer for quite a while here, but recently I started exploring my v60 again after it's collected dust on the shelves for a while. I've been getting a bit confused at the comparison between their brew times using the same dose, grind size, recipe, etc., 

I've been finding the kalita has been consistently having a brew time :20 - 30 shorter than my v60, despite what everyone in the world says they have, where it's flipped. What is it? Bypass? Clogging? Is it the filters I'm using?"
0,"another Aeropress recipe... but this one is good i promise After YEARS of bouncing between different brewing methods, I’ve finally settled on a recipe. A repeatable recipe that consistently yields high-quality cups of coffee with no astringency. This is what I’ve settled on after brewing \~5 or so cups per day on the Aeropress for the last few months. I can honestly say that I haven’t had to tweak this recipe with the coffees I buy.

The basis of my recipe is James Hoffman’s Ultimate Aeropress recipe, with a few modifications:

Grind Setting: 1 setting under 2 on my Fellow Ode with the OG burrs

Temperature: 210F

Dose: 15g

H2O: 250g

1.  Add coffee grounds to the Aeropress

2.  50g bare kettle pour (gooseneck kettle), then immediately pour the remaining 190g through a MeloDrip (I usually finish pouring around :35)

3.  Insert the plunger and wait for a minimum of 2 minutes

4.  Once 2 minutes have elapsed, remove plunger (being careful not to suck your filter out of place) and gently stir until all grounds have been submerged. This should just take a second or two. Only one or two “laps” around the brew chamber. Re-apply plunger, but don’t press yet.

5.  At 2:40, time to press. It’ll generally take me 20-25 seconds for the plunger to reach the coffee grounds. If I’m not in a hurry I’ll let it steep until 4-5 minutes have elapsed (see note below)

6.  Stir (or pour your coffee into a mug) and enjoy!

A few comments:

* I was never a high temperature guy until I settled on this recipe. My theory is that the minimized agitation (through the MeloDrip) and gentle stir reduce the violence happening inside the brew chamber, allowing me to brew at a higher temp without overextracting.
* My (admittedly anecdotal) evidence is that a gentle stir is able to more easily re-incorporate all the grounds into the slurry. Oftentimes with a swirl, my experience was that a normal strength swirl still left the “crust” of coffee grounds intact on top of the brew bed.
* After reading Jonathan Gagne’s article on his adaptation of James’ recipe, I’m not as concerned with brew times. The times I list above are minimums. Longer brew times do seem to yield slightly better cups. I’m generally
* I’ve tried the Aesir filters, can’t really say I noticed a difference.
* I drink exclusively washed coffees, typically on the lighter side of medium. Lots of Colombia, Guatemala, and Kenya. I’ve tried this recipe with natural coffees and the results were disastrous.
* I use distilled + third wave water
* Brewers gathering dust in my basement: v60, wave, flower, clever, chemex, bloom, tricolate (though, I want to circle back to this one if Fellow ever sends out upgraded burrs)

Anyway, if you have the equipment, try it out and let me know what you think!"

0,"GIFTS FOR COFFEE LOVERS? READ SOME SUGGESTION HERE. Making a cup of coffee is deeply personal. From the beans to the brewing method, every devoted coffee drinker has quirks and preferences to make the daily ritual their own. That’s why, when it comes to buying gifts for coffee lovers, it helps to gather some intel, first. Whether their perfect hot coffee or cold coffee, pour over coffee or french press coffee, they could find right coffee wares according to their brewing method in DHPO.

Hot coffee is the first choice in winter. What’s happier than holding a cup of hot coffee in the cold winter? I think is make hot coffee by yourself and ejoy the process! Maybe you don’t how to choose from pour over coffee and [**french press coffee**]( Let’s talk about them both one by one.

Pour over coffee is a classic brewing method that’s becoming increasingly popular. This simple and elegant way of brewing fresh coffee is slightly different than an immersion brewing method. Because it is constantly saturating the coffee grounds with new, fresh water. It’s also known as drip coffee or filter coffee, the pour over brewing method is an infusion method that extracts the flavors yet leaves many of the natural oils in the filter. This method also prevents the coffee grinds from becoming over-saturated with water. There are 2 kinds of pour over coffee wares on the market are most popular. One is glass material and another one is ceramic material.

For glass material pour over, you could choose CHEMEX – simple, easy to use with timeless, elegant design. All CHEMEX Coffeemakers comes with highest quality, non-porous Borosilicate glass which will not absorb odors or chemical residues.

;#x200B;

 For ceramic material [**pour over**]( you could choose DHPO- luxury, minimalist and personalized. This pour-over coffee kit features with professional grade ceramic with wooden lid and sleeve. This ceramic coffee maker doesn’t absorb odors or flavors from anything else. There is no compromise on flavor, every brew is as pure as the last. 

;#x200B;

 French press coffee maker is a popular brewing method because it’s an easy and affordable way to make delicious fresh coffee in the comfort of your own home. French press machine steeps coffee grounds in hot water, then separates the grounds out to leave only the coffee liquid. The hot water is poured into a cylindrical glass carafe holding the coffee grounds. The grounds are left to steep, and then the plunger with a stainless steel filter is pushed to the bottom of the carafe to press the grounds. Many people now use glass French pressure pots. For example, BODUM has many classic glass French pressure pots. But more and more people choose to use ceramic French pressure pots because the ceramic material French press could keep warm for longer time.

 I hope this article can help you choose favorite gifts for coffee lovers. No matter which one you prefer, they will bring you a wonderful coffee experience."

0,"What percentage of coffee drinkers is aware specialty coffee exists? In my experience, it's a very very small minority. And for most of my life, that included me. Before I got introduced into the world of speciality coffee, all black coffee I've had was either bitter or sour and I never knew why anyone would like it. I thought coffee connoisseurs was probably a sham, like how people can't taste fine wine above a certin price. I stayed curious and went to many different cafes and eventually stumbled upon speciality coffee. They had a coffee that tasted fruity, like blueberries. It didn't resemble anything like coffee I've ever had. It tasted as different as beer and soda to me.   


My journey into specialty coffee since led me to try out the unique flavor profiles of various single-origins and process methods and dial in my grind sizes to optimize the extraction. It has been an awesome adventure to experience a vast variety of flavor profiles with so many complexities of notes, ranging from chocolatey, fruity, floral, citrusy.

Found this corroborating note:

; Recent studies have shown that water can only penetrate to a depth of 100 microns from the surface.

Would it not be better to grind as small as possible (within reasonable limits) assuming that any part of the bean untouched by water is just waste."

0,"Recommendations for ways to grind coffee? I've been looking into ways to grind my own coffee, especially for cold brewing as it is moderately/relatively warm where I live most of the year.  A month ago for Black Friday, I got a JavaPresse hand grinder as I felt it was a good value for the price (esp on Amazon Black Friday).  As it turns out, it took a lot of effort to grind a batch of coffee for my cold brew pitcher, which I didn't mind too much as I like to give myself a workout every now and then, but more annoyingly, it kept getting stuck at random times, so I threw in the towel on it a month in and returned it.  (Not too surprised now after seeing the complaints of the same grinder on this sub)

For now, I've resorted to grinding using my Ninja blender, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to ensure that I can get a coarse grind.  Should I get another hand grinder, or may it be more worth it to invest in an electric grinder.  Or is there something else that may be more worth looking into?  I want something that is more portable and doesn't take up too much space, so any recommendations either way?"
0,"Did I ruin my K-plus? Hey Guys,

;#x200B;

I just bought my K-plus from 1zpresso. I was excited and took it out of the box and popped the crank on because I wanted to give it a few turns. I put it on and gave it maybe 10-20 spins and was surprised it appeared to have some resistance, mild resistance, but definitely resistance. I then realised that this was likely due to the burrs rubbing (grinder was at 0.5ish). I adjusted up to close to 1 on the setting and it still did this! Then at 1 it moved freely.

;#x200B;

My two questions are 

;#x200B;

1. Is the grinder/burrs ruined because of the turns I did with the burrs rubbing?
2. Is this a faulty unit? I would assume 0 would be burrs touching and anything above this would then create space? Or is this normal?

I used to have a Philips brand espresso machine that I just never seemed to be able to master in terms of espresso flavor. I downgraded to a Keurig Cafe machine (with the milk frother) but this also wasnt great. Ive been trying out a french press but I feel like I’m messing up my coffee/water ratio… since experimenting with it, it’s also had a pretty bitter flavor. 

Ive tried beans of all sorts of different types and roasts, from espresso roasts to flavored roasts. I always try to use the recommended grind (fine for when I had the espresso machine, coarse for the french press right now). 

Honestly the best thing ive been making at home has been store bought cold brew concentrate that I just heat up like regular coffee. Its not amazing but it at least tastes like coffee and isnt super bitter.

0,"Issue with Breville Smart Grinder Pro (820 XL) I thought i'd try posting, maybe someone might be able to help me.  I made it here through finding this other post: [ SGP simply won't drop grinds.  Much of the issue is very similar to this post from the other thread: [ the entire story: 

I've been trying to use my SGP.  Lately fewer and fewer grinds are actually going through.  When I bought the machine new, I could set it on a fine setting of 12 and I actually had to reduce the grind time to 12 sec or so to fill up a 2 shot basket from 19 sec.  Last time it worked, I had to run it twice at the ""default"" 19 sec to fill up the basket. 

;#x200B;

I ""think"" the issue started back when I shifted one time to grind french press size - I'd changed the grind settings to about 54.  Grinding a few times before on ""drip"" settings, I'd get right at the perfect amount for 8 cups off a default 8 cup setting (as measured by the container that comes with the unit).  The last time I'd changed it to the coarser setting, I only got half what I needed and had to run it twice.  Latestly when I tried to run it for french press, I had to run it for at least 3x the needed time.  

;#x200B;

I've contacted Breville support and done just about everything they've recommended/know how to do.  I can completely vacume everything out with pulling out the top bur, load beans, and nada.  I even tried running rice through it like recommended (on the coarsest setting).  Rice ran through no issues, went back to beans, nothing.  

;#x200B;

The best bet I can see is it looks like grinds build up around the impeller at the bottom, almost forming a ""ring"" around it and just weren't dropping down, and then clogging the rest of the process.  I've looked at the ""replacement"" impellers online, but they're all for the 800 series and older, not the new 820.

0,"So you got an AeroPress. Congratulations, you've finally upgraded from a french press or maybe this is your first brewer. How do you make the most of it (for black coffee)? 

First thing to note is that making the best coffee requires the best possible bean. [this]( is an amazing guide towards acquiring good beans. I'd recommend getting a lot of samplers to enjoy the diversity coffee can provide. 

Next, the biggest upgrade you can make to your setup is a grinder. I personally like hand grinders since you can get better quality equipment (Steel burrs, for example) for a bit cheaper, and they are portable. There are plenty of grinders ranging from Hario to Comandante but the best entry level grinder so far is the Timemore C2, just get one, you won't regret making the investment.

Once you have all this, you need to weigh your beans, don't worry about getting a fancy scale, any generic scale with 0.1g accuracy will work just fine since the AeroPress is an immersion brewer. I use a $3 generic jewelery scale and it works pretty well. I use my old aeropress with water level markings to measure water and pour (is it disrespectful to the FP? Maybe.)  

Now, load the beans in your grinder in a 1:16 ratio (Coffee to Water in grams, standard recipe is 15g to 250ml) and adjust your grinder to 14 clicks (works best for me). Adjust it by putting on the arm, and rotating clockwise all the way till it can't go further, and then slowly count your clicks to 14 (sometimes 15, but this is the sweet spot for me). 

You can then use the [hoffmann recipe]( since it's the least-effort-to-highest-quality one out there, keeping with the AeroPress spirit of incredible ease and amazing results. There are world champion recipes out there as well, but they use WAY TOO MUCH COFFEE sometimes and it's good to experiment once in a while, but those aren't feasible for everyday use.

I stick to Hoffmann recipe because it's consistent and very easy to remember, there are very few 'steps' required to reach a delicious cup, and low risks since it's a standard method. Switch it up by trying 2 papers for an even cleaner brew, try different coffees and see what makes you happy. 

I started from very dark, smoky-ashy tasting beans, to dark chocolaty-nutty ones, to floral-sweet ones and finally fruity and in-your-face wine flavoured ones. There's just so much to explore out there and the Aeropress is such a good instrument to experience all of it with minimal effort into brewing and cleanup. I can't say that I am snobby enough to taste all niche flavours in the coffee, but the differences are very apparent once you stick to a single recipe and just try different beans."

0,"I modded my Hario Pro grinder to give it stepless adjustment. I can't believe I didn't think about this sooner.

So for a long time the biggest drawback with my Hario grinder has been that the steps are too large. I can pull a shot where it takes 20 seconds start to finish, knock the grind size down a step, and then it takes a minute and a half. Part of this is that the grinder isn't really the best grinder for espresso and it could do with grinding a bit more evenly. However, I should ideally be able to make finer grind adjustments than that, right?

So I had an idea to ditch the included adjustment nut and instead use a regular nut and a washer. You're looking specifically for an M6 fender washer (to cover/protect the stock adjustment nubs) and an M6x1.0 nylock nut (nylon insert lock nut). This will ensure that the adjustment nut doesn't move around during grinding.

I removed the factory adjustment nut and replaced it with the washer first followed by the nut. You will likely need a wrench or pliers to spin the adjustment nut once the nylon engages with the threads on the axle. I also made some marks on the nut and the burr holder to act as guides for how much to adjust. 

Et voilà ! Infinitely-variable grind adjustment on the cheap. It doesn't really fix the unevenness, but at least you can get the base grind setting dialled in better. I found that one full turn out from gently seated was a good starting point for my Flair, probably a couple of flats less for a pump espresso maker with a full-size basket.

Cons: you need a wrench to make grind adjustments with this. There just isn't any way for the nut to stay in place without it being too stiff otherwise. If you can happen to find a nylock wing nut in the appropriate size, you might be able to still adjust the grind by hand."

0,"A quick (biased) review of the Timemore Black Mirror ""plus"" Hello! I am fairly new to coffee, but I wanted to invest in some nice equipment, including a scale. I was intrigued by the aesthetic, supposedly fast response time, and auto functions of the Timemore Black Mirror Plus. When I saw it on Amazon for a flash sale for 44 dollars, I pulled the trigger. However, as a newcomer, I feel like I encounter some struggles that should be known about this scale you are, like me, new. So, as a quick review
;nbsp;

Pros

* Seemingly fast refresh rate (great for pour over)
* Able to be recharged (no battery waste)
* Super long battery life
* Very cool aesthetic
* Waterproof (IIRC)

now, for the cons
;nbsp;

Cons

* The buttons are way too SENSITIVE
     * I wish the buttons were physical
     * To elaborate, even waving your hand over the buttons can activate them. Trying to move the scale? You just messed up your timing. A drop of water gets on the tare button? Now you don't know how much water is in the brewer.  
* The auto mode is very limited
     * For espresso, the auto time-start feature is great. However, you the auto time-stop feature will not engage until the clock has ran for at least 40 seconds, meaning that removing your cup after a 30 second shot will not automatically stop the timer
     * The setting above cannot be changed
     * The auto-stop feature can also not be disabled (according to my knowledge) meaning that if you want to, say, lift your V60 to do a Rao-spin, the timer will stop due to the removal of the brewer
* It's not cheap
     * At around $50 US, it's around 1/6th of the cost of my entire espresso machine (Bambino)
     * At that pricepoint, these cons are pretty deal-breaking IMO. 
* This scale doesn't work with the app, to track flow rate etc. Even if it did, would it be good?

;nbsp; This is a little bit on the negative side, but I wanted to like this scale so badly (especially after reading good reviews) only to find that it's, unfortunately, frustrating."

0,"What's wrong with my coffee (if anything)? Here is my current setup: Using a Chemex, bleached paper filters, James Hoffman's Chemex/V60 method, water at 205 degrees, fresh locally roasted coffee, a 1:15 ratio, using a burr grinder and varying between medium/medium-coarse/medium-fine grinds to find the right one. 

I have been slowly getting into the specialty coffee game over the last couple of years, always drinking it black. I don't have much reference for what Chemex coffee should taste like other than the coffee I make myself. I do enjoy the coffee that I make but always wonder if it tastes as it is supposed to or if it could be better. My coffee definitely has a ""sharp"" taste that I cannot distinguish between sour or bitter, and I would like to get rid of that but have started to wonder if that's just what coffee tastes like because it is there seemingly no matter what I change. I was using a medium-coarse grind for a while (like a 16 out of 19 or so), but felt my coffee was too watery so I moved down a notch and had been liking the strength of it. 

Then I made a cup for my wife this morning and she told me that whenever I make her coffee it has a very bitter taste that overpowers the creamer that she likes and makes it unenjoyable. We both kept tasting it and trying to pinpoint the taste she was experiencing but had a hard time telling if it was sour, bitter, or something else. She kept pouring more creamer in her cup and told me that even with loads of creamer in it the bad taste of the coffee was so overpowering that she didn't even taste the creamer. She definitely enjoys some coffees but wouldn't describe herself as a ""coffee person"" (she likes lattes from Starbucks, sweet/sugary creamers, etc.). I brewed a few more cups to try to fix the issue, first at an even finer grind size which we initially thought was better before realizing it wasn't, then back up two notches to a medium-coarse grind, and they all had the same sour/bitter taste. 

There are so many variables that I'm not sure what the issue could be. It could be the ratio of coffee to water, the grind size, the water temperature, the recipe/method, *or maybe my wife just doesn't like the brighter flavor of Chemex coffee (?)*.

0,"Amateur looking for a simple coffee maker for two people My fiancé and I are currently use a basic, 12 cup Black and Decker to make coffee for just the two of us. We’ve grown to really enjoy our morning coffee but figure we should upgrade our machine to something that will actually make a good cup. 

We’d ideally like something relatively easy, as on work days we fly out the door quickly. The Moccamaster One Cup is what we’re eyeballing. May also get an Aeropress for weekends when we’re lounging. But I figure a maker specifically for smaller batches will make better coffee than our 12 cup maker does, so would like something made for 1-6 cups. 

But as far as a coffee maker for hectic mornings and two people, any suggestions?"

0,"What can i use too fine ground coffee for? The coffee shop i usually order coffee from ground my beans way too fine for espresso, it clogs the filter (yeah i know i should buy a grinder, i'm looking into it). They sent me a new bag for free but now i have some great coffee i can't use. 

I have a V60, i was thinking of trying to brew with lower temp water 70-85°C but i'm not sure and I don't want to spend an hour brewing 10 bad coffees just to find the correct temp/ratio for a grind I won't (hopefully) use again. Is there a way to brew something semi decent with it?

0,"Possible to make good coffee with a percolator? I recently watched a video from Technology Connections highlighting the flaws of old school coffee percolators. I didn't know anything about them before watching the video, and I was surprised to find out that they are basically moka pots (a brewer that I love) that don't have two chambers to keep the brewed coffee separate from the water. That is to say, the brewed coffee drips right back into the heated water and recirculates through the grounds until the brew reaches an appropriate strength.

I found the idea of brewed coffee going back through the grounds an interesting concept, no other brewers do this. I found it so interesting that despite just watching an entire video explaining why they're bad, I'm tempted to buy a percolator and attempt to make good coffee with it anyway-- partially to satiate my curiosity as to what exactly it tastes like, and partially as a challenge to myself to see if I could figure out how to make good coffee with it. So, given that context, my question is this: has anyone else tried to make good, specialty grade coffee with that old school style of percolator? Is there any technique that actually yields a good result, or is it not worth trying?"

I'm currently using the Feima 600N which I bought at around $100. Pretty satisfied with it, but the fines and noise has started to irritate me a bit. I'm looking for a new electric grinder priced at around $500. 

I usually brew filter coffee, at around 1\~2 cups on a daily basis. I prefer medium to medium high roasted coffee. I also use the Cafflano Kompresso (a simple, manual espresso maker) about 1-2 times a week, but thinking about upgrading to something like the Flair Pro 2.

I live in a apartment-type house, so noise would also have to be considered.

I've come up with a few options for this kind of usage:

\- DF64 (about $500)

\- Lagom mini (about $500)

\- Eureka Mignon Filtro (not in stock now?)

\- Upgrade the Feima 600N with SSP burrs (available for about $110)

Any new suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Thanx ;)"

0,"From Nespresso to a (real) espresso machine! Which machine is a great beginner? Hey there, hope everyone is in Christmas spirits and kinda having a good time in these crazy times.

As I am working mostly from home since the pandemic started and at times I'm dying of boredom, I realised that I really want to improve my barista skills and dive deeper into the coffee world!

I've had a Nespresso machine for a year now but I want more! I've watched a few reviews on youtube, also the classic ones from James Hoffmann, but a lot of the coffee talk is difficult to follow as a beginner.

I'd love to make a great espresso ; cappuccino, but I don't want to get too overwhelmed by the change to an espresso machine with all these extraction, temperature, coffee grinding knowledge!

Which machine would be the best to start with, considering that I don't have a clue about all this barista knowledge right now. I'm willing to learn of course but right now I'd need a machine that allows me to make great coffee without knowing everything in detail.

Things that confuse me right now are for instance: why in all videos I've watched the coffee beans are ground just a moment before the extraction. But why is there ground coffee available in supermarkets then? Why not just take one and skip the grinding process at home and all these costs? Does it make the coffee that much better? Also, if I should get a grinder, which are better? The old-school ""by hand"" grinders or machines that do the job - but seem extremely loud?

Would appreciate some tips! Happy holidays!"

0,"Bambino+ and 1zpresso jx - sour/acidic shots? (UK) I know this is a common question but I'd like some guidance for my specific setup.

I've got myself the 1zpresso jx manual grinder. I found looking at the guide when I did one full turn which says is the espresso grind range, chocked the machine out. So I went for one and half turns from my 0 point and have been dialing back slowly since.

Currently at about 40 clicks from zero.

I'm using the red jail break blend from has bean with a roast date of 7th Jan.

I am new to all this, I know my tamping is an issue as I am struggling to get an even tamp which probably is not helping.

It seems not matter what I do, whether it be a manual shot for 18g in 36 out, the coffee tastes off to me (again I am struggling as a noob to understand acidicy vs sourness) and the crema isn't that great in my opinion. The coffee tastes a bit burnt and lacks any flavours I would expect from the roast description.

Do I need to keep dialing in finer on the grinder + sort my tamping evenness out to unlock the flavours? Pull a longer shot?

Times seem OK. About 25 secs from button to finish and it doesn't start coming out until around 8/9 seconds in.

I'm thinking maybe I need to buy some cheapo beans to play with rather than the good stuff to get my head around it all.

Are medium roasts okay for the bambino? Or should I only stay in the dark roast range.

So I try a starbucks pumpkin spice latte cup, and I'm a huge fan of the starbucks PSL from the actual shop.  


Brewing, it smelled disgusting, like toilet cleaner. I hope for the best, wait for it to cool down, and taste nothing short of windshield wiper fluid. I'm heartbroken. I was so excited to try these coffees, but they taste worse than I could even describe. So acidic, so bad, I feel guilty even pouring them into my plants as I worry it could kill them instantly. What am I doing wrong? Do people actually like these the way they are? I got these and didn't expect I'd need to put creamer or sugar in them, imagining that they would already HAVE flavor.

Last week I brought an espresso machine and had to use the fine grind setting for the first time ever and for some reason the beans just don't go through the machine they just sit there while the machine whirrs. 

The grinder makes the same sound it would make if there weren't any beans in the hopper. I've taken the whole thing apart and thoroughly cleaned it and that didn't help. I also tried putting a couple drops of water in with a coffee beans and that didn't help. 

Any idea what I'm doing wrong here? All help appreciate it"

0,"Alright, upped my game significantly. Timmemore C2, Pilot specialty coffee and Aeropress. Bout to see if it's THAT much better. Okay, it actually is pretty good. But this did Cost some $$$ especially for a student. I'd honestly think past this the law's of diminishing returns kicks in pretty hard.   


I've gone from instant, to Folgers, to ground Tim's to whole bean Tims.   


Used the method on pilot's website on how to brew for aero press and 14clicks from 0 on the timmore C2.   


Its not a STARK difference from whole bean Tims. Tim Hortons whole bean original has a bit of a burnt taste to it, almost charred. It's funny this specialty roast is a dark roast and seems mellower than Tim's original, I don't know how to explain this but it actually feels good going down. It HAS a darker taste, but doesn't have a burnt aftertaste. Also still tastes decent when the coffee starts to cool down a bit. 

  
I like it. But I am not sure the roast is worth 2x the price.   


Most of the specialty roasts near me are all along the same price."

0,"Cometeer has me re-evaluating my entire coffee setup I won't be posting any referral links (or links to their site). I'm not a paid shill for Cometeer though I'm sure I'll come off as one.  Not linking to their site.  I've searched this sub for Cometeer but surprised to see little talk about it. 

Watched Hoffman's video about the $500k grinder which led me to Cometeer.  I initially balked at the price ($44 with the discount) but given it's the holidays and in the mood to splurge I went for it.   The 4-pack light roast pack has 32 pods/cups.   

Melted the pod, Yirgacheffe from Birch, and gave it a stir in my water.   Took a sip and [my reaction](   Flavorful, rich, deep, clean, barely any acidity...damn good.  I was (and am) honestly amazed.     Is this how specialty instant coffee is?  

For reference, my daily setup is a Virtuoso, a v60, and a gooseneck kettle.  Usually Happy Mug beans but also various other local and shipped stuff.  Filtered Zerowater with Third Wave additive.  I've used Hoffman, Rao, and 4:6 methods.  Typically 25g to 400g of water (1:16).

I'm questioning my entire setup. Thought was making good coffee, but now know I was not. It was too harsh, acidic, astringent.    I've trying things to improve: different grind sizes and ratios, cleaning, sifting, different methods of v60.  I have replaced the top burr of my Virtuoso and have a Kalita Wave coming to try that.   I got some high quality beans from a local roaster.  If I sift and remove most of the fines I get a real clean cup, low acidity, but it doesn't have the depth (which I understand is the result of less fines).    

Even with all the above experiments, I can tell I am not close.   I have doubts I'll be able to achieve the same quality as the Cometeer pod without a new grinder.  I'm considering a 1zpresso K series.   This ~$40 box of instant coffee is turning out to be quite a bit more expensive that I originally thought.   

The other con, aside from cost, is that it's quite wasteful - the packing materials, shipping, the pods themselves, boxes: it is a *lot* of waste for 32 cups.  

Anyone have reviews/comments/comparisons of other instant coffee pods?  Anyone tried these pods and compare to a v60 - any tips on achieving the same results with a v60?  Would LOVE to get there with my v60."

0,"Flair Classic questions Hey,

Just bought a flair classic and spent a while trying to dial it in without much success so far, my espresso does seem to have a thick creme but tastes very bitter/sour.

I just have a few questions for other flair users to see if what I am experiencing is normal and to help make the process a bit smoother:

1. When I'm filling the brewing chamber with water, I notice the water very quickly turns brown and some coffee is obviously flowing up into the brewing chamber, is this normal or have I done something wrong?
2. When I'm finished pulling my shot when taking the brewing head apart the dispersion screen ends up inside the brewing chamber, makes it rather messy to clean
3. My coffee cake once finished is rather wet and soggy, not dry like the example videos show. I know this normally indicates grind is too fine but I have been gradually going coarser, and while it is improving I'm finding the shot doesn't take much pressure at all to pull, I still get a creme and taste does get better however I feel if I go much coarser it won't be able to get the right pressure and the shot will pull too quickly.
4. Where do you exactly fill the brewing chamber to? on the example videos it says the etched line, on mine there is a hard to see tiny etched line somewhere near the top, and then a larger etched very close to the top, which one of these are you supposed to use? I tried both and found it does seem to overflow if I fill to the top one but asking for sanity sake.

For dosage I am using 15g of dark roast, using a Normcore v2 grinder set to around 15ish clicks from finest. I also preheat the brewing chamber twice with boiling water as suggested.

Being the classic I don't have a pressure gauge however I have ordered one to make it easier but its a few weeks out.

Would love any tips anyone has and any help with my questions above, thanks!"

*Up until now I had a cheap blade grinder (please don't judge!), so I assume anything will be better. 
*I use medium roast coffee,  nothing fancy.
*I drink espresso and drip, have Breville espresso machine. 
*My max budget is 450 CAD/ 350 USD if I buy through Amazon with a gift card and points. Honestly,  I would feel more comfortable to spend less than that. 

I looked at manual grinders that can be around $200 , but I'm not sure how easy they grind and they look so small. If I need to make a few cups of drip coffee it looks like it will take me long time to grind this amount. 
I don't plan to travel with it so portability is not an issue.  

With all this information do you think I'll even notuce the difference between an expensive grinder or is it not worth the money? 

If you like a specific brand and model I'll be happy to get a recommendation.

For background, I spend a lot of time traveling already and am sure to visit multiple coffee farms whenever I am in a region that produces it (this is why I’m interested in this idea).

An idea I recently had is starting a company that imports high-end and organic coffee from small, locally-owned farms across the world. For example, I would purchase 300 bags of coffee grounds from a small farm and list it on the website as a new “drop.” People can buy while supplies last and we ship to them. Each drop would feature detailed information and maybe even include a collector’s card or something with each bag. 

If people like the coffee, we will have an option to order more later. But the main component of the business would be having a lot of drops of different kinds of coffee and helping to bring smaller, unknown farms  to market. 

Just looking for general feedback about this idea. I already know a lot of people who work at coffee farms in central and South America so I’m interested in doing something with that network.

0,"Light Roast brewing help needed for Dark Roast peeps Hi,
  
My spouse ; I both love dark roast coffees but I've been wanting to branch out ; try some of the lighter roasts. They are the ""it thing"" right now, (seemingly for good reason) ; I don't want to overlook them. :)
   
So, I went down to our local coop and picked up some whole bean single origin Colombian. It was called a light/med roast (but it was light, not just from a dark roast perspective). Long story short, we hated it. I only got about 3oz and it was miserable getting through it, even though it was only a few cups' worth.
  
I then got an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (not sure how it was processed) and it was a little better. But then I realized, I'm not sure I'm brewing it to the best it can be, since I have the most experience brewing dark roasts.
  
I'm hoping you might share some help/advice/suggestions on how to brew light roasts - for a dark roast person? This new year, before I give up and just determine that we're ""not light roast people"", I want it give it the best chance possible. Right now, we're mostly making espresso but we have other gear, too (Aeropress, French Press, etc) ; we measure/grind fresh before each brew. I'd really appreciate any thoughts! Thanks so much - and happy new year!"

0,"Turkish coffee: history, legends and classic recipe The history of Turkish coffee dates back to 1552, when coffee was brought to Istanbul by two merchants from Syria.

The drink began to spread rapidly - it was served in the mansions of the nobility, but soon public coffee shops began to open.

;#x200B;

**The appearance of a Turkish coffee recipe and interesting facts, straight from Istanbul**

Already in 1554, a coffee shop ""Kiva Khan"" was opened in the port quarter of Takhtakale, where visitors were not only sold coffee beans, but also offered to drink a cup of hot drink. It was here that the method of grinding and brewing coffee in Turkish was invented: arabica beans were fried and ground into flour in a hand mill, after which they were poured into a copper jezva (a traditional Turk with a long wooden handle, which the Turks call gügüm), poured with water and slowly brought on hot coals until foam appeared.

;#x200B;

;The process of roasting coffee in Turkish is called Tahmis, and the Takhtakale area still has a street called Tahmis Eminonu in memory of Kiva Han.

In 1564, the first public coffee shop in Istanbul was opened and it was the first coffee shop in the world. Then, the drink began to be served everywhere, and Turkish coffee shops became cultural centers - men gathered in them to spend the evening talking, discussing the latest news and art, playing backgammon.

;#x200B;

The invigorating drink played such an important role in the cultural and social life of society that the wives and concubines of the sultan in the harem necessarily took a course of proper coffee preparation. Women of lower rank also mastered this art with might and main – the tastier the girl brewed coffee, the more chances she had to get married successfully.

;#x200B;

Since only men were allowed to visit coffee shops for a long time, women drank coffee at home or in a hamam. There is an opinion that in the Ottoman Empire there was a law according to which a woman could file for divorce from her husband if he was unable to cover her expenses for two or three cups of coffee a day.

;#x200B;

;However, the coffee mania that spread in Turkey began to worry the authorities, who believed that coffee loosens tongues, and philosophical and political conversations are held in coffee shops, often unflattering for the existing authorities. And during the reign of Sultan Murad IV (1623-1640), all residents of the Ottoman Empire were banned from drinking coffee on pain of death penalty (similar restrictions also affected alcoholic beverages and smoking). Those who violated the ban were waiting for the gallows. According to rumors, some were even sewn into a bag of coffee beans and thrown into the sea. However, the number of illegal coffee shops continued to grow steadily and Murad's successors soon had to lift this ban.

Now, coffee is one of the most popular drinks, and Turkish coffee is served all over the world.

;#x200B;

**Classic Turkish coffee recipe**

It is distinguished by its density and strength: in a classic recipe, 25g of ground coffee is added to 150ml of water. To prepare it, you will need a copper jezva and hot sand, on which the coffee is brought to the appearance of foam. Serving a drink without foam is considered indecent.

;#x200B;

Turkish coffee is usually prepared with one of three ""sweetness levels"", from sweet, like halva (şekerli), with a little added sugar (orta) to almost bitter, without sugar (sade). It is believed that harsh people with a strong character drink exclusively sade. The same coffee is drunk in Turkish companies during difficult negotiations. It is customary to serve a small glass glass with cold water to a cup of Turkish coffee in coffee shops. Water should be drunk before coffee to refresh the taste buds.

;#x200B;

**A little bit about Turkish customs**

A cup of Turkish coffee is endowed with many important connotations for Turks: friendship, affection and reciprocity. This is best illustrated by the old saying: ""One cup of coffee can create a friendship that lasts 40 years.""

;#x200B;

Turkish coffee is such an integral part of Turkish culture that it gave its name to the word ""breakfast"" (kahvaltı), which translates as ""before coffee"" and comes from the words ""coffee"" (kahve) and ""before"" (altı).

;#x200B;

Serving a cup of Turkish coffee is also a gesture of friendship. The preparation and care of the host about serving Turkish coffee to his guests is an important aspect of hospitality.

In Turkey, traditionally, the bride-to-be serves coffee to her groom and his family when they come to ask for her hand in marriage.

Accepting a cup of coffee by a guest is a source of pride for the host of the house. This is reflected in the Turkish expressions ""his coffee can be drunk"" (kahvesi içilir olmak) and ""I would drink a cup of your coffee"" (bir kahveni içerim)."

0,"What is your recommendation for a decent, cheapish, electric burr coffee grinder? I realize that this question is asked every year or two; but since it hasn't been asked for at least a year and new grinders have probably come on the market during that time, I'm hoping that you all will indulge me and give me your recommendations.

Background (if it's necessary): Alas, my Krups KVX1 appears to be no more, as it just sits there, mute, when I push the power button. I've actually disassembled it in hopes that I might be able to figure out why it's unhappy, but I've had no luck. It appears that I need a new one.

I'm not looking for the best grinder out there, since I couldn't come anywhere near affording it anyway. I guess I'd be happy with something comparable to my deceased Krups.

So if you were me and needed a decent but cheap grinder, what would you choose? (By ""cheap,"" I'm thinking ~$50.)

0,"I need McDonald's drive-thru level convenience for coffee making I buy a large McDonalds or Burger King coffee and am fine with it. I drink it black. It is the most convenient way to get coffee except on the days where I cannot leave my house. It is convenient because there are zero parts to clean each day and it takes me zero seconds to make the coffee.

Besides the cup itself, what is the machine makes 16 - 20 ounces of coffee with the least amount of setup/steps, and that has the fewest and simplest parts to clean by hand each day after the coffee is made. I am looking for a machine that requires cleaning either one or zero simple parts daily. I quit making coffee long ago because each day you had to put a filter in the maker, put ground coffee in it, put it in a pot, clean all that stuff after throwing stuff away etc. I have never used one of those pod type machines, and I know nothing about them so someone will have to tell me which one works for me if thats the answer.

I am sorry I do not drink high quality coffee. I am ok with this. BTW, I will even settle for a 16-20 ounce Americano. Doesn't matter to me, I am not picky. Only instant coffee is disgusting to me, that's the line."

Yet, my cholesterol is 50 points higher than it was, my bad cholesterol is about 40 points higher and I am showing other signs of cardiovascular inflammation.

Naturally, my first attempt at explaining this is to look at what I have changed and roasting my own coffee is the only major change I have done. 

My process is to roast the coffee in the SR800 (about a 9 minute process) and let it ""air"" for 12-24 hours in a partially covered jar. After that I grind a drink. The SR800 does not get rid of ALL the coffee bean husks and some make it into my coffee but I would say not many. That's it.

 the most notable issue is after maybe 5 minutes on, water and steam start spurting out of a valve ontop of the boiler (vacuum valve I think), which carries on until you turn it off. I'm not entirely sure whether it is only the valve that doesn't work, or if there is another issue in the system that is causing it

 The pressure guage on the front doesn't work either, the plastic housing on the inside is cracked, I don't think this is related to the valve though as the guage stopped working long before the steam started shooting out the top.

Has anyone else had these issues, or know any potential fixes? or something to check/clean before ordering replacement parts?"

Imagine my surprise when my brother-in-law showed up at our house for Christmas with this beast under his arm.  I was blown away, may have teared up a little, and I’m still just giddy with excitement.  He actually carried this thing on the plane.  Such a bro.

He has a new single-dose grinder and he knew that I would appreciate and care for his cherished old Rancilio.  I’m doing single/double servings in my little Zojirushi 5-cup drip brewer and I am thrilled with the results.

I’ve long used a blade grinder and just happily lived in denial of the superiority of burr grinding.  It’s kinda crazy too because I have an engineer brain and thrive on precision and control.  It’s been a few days now and I’ve ground beans across a range of settings. I find it quite remarkable how just a slight adjustment can make a huge difference in the taste and body of the final product. What I was doing previously with the blade grinder was pure insanity by comparison.

I am curious about the numbers on the gauge.  Do these digits represent an actual dimension or is it just relative to the machine itself?  I suspect 30 means 300 µm?

Aside from taste, another thing I’ve noticed is the coffee product seems much easier on my stomach.  I think previously I was ingesting a lot of fines and it was really irritating my poor old tummy.

At this point I wish I’d have sucked it up and bought one of these a few decades ago.

0,"What coffee did you grow up with, thinking it was normal and discovering it wasn't for you? For me it was Folgers.

About 6 or 7 years ago we had some really good coffee in Costa Rica, I wanted to find that coffee after that trip. So we set out to taste every coffee from Costa Rica, well that turned into tasting a whole lot more than just Costa Rica coffees and more than medium roasts too...It's been a real adventure. Oh and we did find that coffee.

0,"How to tell if coffee is a dark or light roast? This feels like a silly question, but my local roastery doesn't list what beans are dark roasts or light roasts, so I've mostly gone based on the ""notes"" to figure out what I want to buy. There's always descriptions of the coffee, but it mostly has to do about where it comes from. As I delve more into coffee though, I see people talking about dark/light roasts, but I don't know how to derive that from these descriptions. Is there something I should be looking for, or should I just be asking the shop about it?

Here's an example of one of their descriptions:

; A certified organic coffee from Ethiopia!  And naturally processed - meaning the ripe red fruit of the coffee cherry was allowed to dry on the seeds.  The drying process was slow and controlled, over two weeks of constant manual rotation on raised and properly aerated drying beds.  The resulting coffee is extremely sweet and infused with fruit flavors - berries, cherries, a bit of citrus - structured around a dark chocolate core.  In addition, everyone involved in the farming, picking and processing this coffee was paid above market wages. Origin: Guji, Ethiopia Elevation: 1900-2100 MASL Producer: Ismel Hassen Varietal: Heirloom Processing: Natural Flavor Notes: Cherry, Blueberry, Toffee"

So with that being said, what are some home espresso machines you would recommend? I got him a milk frothing wand a while back that he likes, but I want to go all out for a machine this time.

I’m not sure if any of this info matters, but:
* He currently he makes his coffee with the “drip” or “pour over” method (I think that’s right at a least.) 
* He doesn’t like sugary drinks. He’ll drink his coffee black or with a little milk, but that’s it.
* The current coffee grounds he has at the moment are: Folgers Black Silk Dark ; Nescafé Toaster’s Choice, also dark. - Will regular grounds work in an espresso machine or do I need to get anything specific? Sorry, I really am clueless lol.
* This is just an issue I have noticed when I’ve been looking at machines, but the cup he uses is 4 1/8 inches tall. I’ve seen some machines that wouldn’t fit a cup this size, so something with more cup space would be great!

I’ve been looking at some De’Longhi models on Amazon, most of which seem to have good reviews, but there’s some things about each of them I’ve just been too unsure about to make a decision, so I figured I’d ask a community more experience ; knowledge on the topic.

0,"Just how different can specialty coffees be? Got a few bags of what I thought would be very similar coffees in the mail today. They're both honey processed Costa Rican caturras, grown just 100km apart. I cupped them and was really shocked to see how different they are. They're even roasted to just about the same level but they couldn't taste more different.
One of them is listed to have nectarine, marmalade, milk chocolate notes and the other plum, apricot, honey. I got these beautiful black tea and fruit flavors from the latter but the first one really took me aback. The first one kind of tasted like dirt and smelled like compost. Not exactly my cup of tea coffee.
I understand Costa Rican coffee has huge varieties in flavor and natural processes can produce these kinds of funky notes but I wasn't expecting it to be this different, especially when the first one was fermented less (yellow vs red honey processed).
Can you please help me understand my preferences better? As I continue to venture into natural processed coffee should I expect coffees with marmalade or jam notes to taste similar to this? Or do I just have to take it bag by bag? I really enjoyed the other two honey processed bags I got, it's just this specific roast that caught me off guard."
0,"Why do fines affect flavor? It seems like the most up-to-date understanding of extraction is that particles of different sizes don't extract differently.  Rather, compounds are rinsed off the surface of the particles, and their size is irrelevant to that process. There are some obvious ways that fines affect different brewing methods, whether that's clogging a filter or landing in your cup. Maybe an uneven grind gets you some channeling, causing turbulence to sweep up some undesirable flavors. Is that all that's going on: particle distribution affecting the way the water moves?  So for instance, if we can keep total surface area constant, cupping with blade-ground coffee should taste no different from an expensive grinder, or from beans smashed with a rock?"

I was on the Hoffman technique for a long time but during the summer I changed to the 4:6 technique. I got some good results with that but nothing consistent. Recently I've changed back to the Hoffman technique and out of 10 cups so far I have got maybe 3 ok cups. I am now trying to brew at a lower temperature. Today I brewed at 93c and still got over extraction. The grind is not too fine (I think) and it brews in almost exactly 2mins.  
When I grind course or brew at lower temp I quickly reach hollow and flavorless brews.  
The last thing to change is my water but I think that my water can be the reason for all this bad tasting, over extracted, bitter coffee.

Got my picopresso yesterday and i have pulled a couple of shots and it seems like i’m getting watery shots.The initial flow of the coffee from the portafilter as it leaves the basket looks thick but everything from thereon is watery.. i have tried 1-5-5 to 1-6-0 and got the same results.. any tips to finetune my espresso making?

Also, do i remove the dosing ring before tamping or i just tamp with the dosing ring still attached to the basket?

Thanks!"
0,"Recommendations for first Electric Burr Grinder I've been using a Javapresse manual burr grinder ($40 USD) for a couple of weeks. It makes great coffee, but it takes like 30min of cranking to grind. Thinking of getting an electric grinder but they all seem way too expensive.

I'm looking at the Baratza encore ($170 USD) since everyone seems to love it. Is it actually worth the price? Or can I get comparable results with something cheaper?

I mostly use an Aeropress. Maybe I'll get a V60 setup in the future"
0,"Suddenly watery coffee - grinder issue? Hello! I've been making Chemex coffee every day for years. I use a scale and variable temperature kettle, so I have full control over the whole process. I grind beans on an older Kitchenaid Proline grinder ('03 or '04, but still going strong). However, I recently got a moka pot, switched up my grinds a bit, and when I turned it back to my favorite Chemex setting - my brew is super watery no matter what I do. I've played around with it, and I can get it a tiny bit stronger but then it takes forever to pour down. Not nearly the same. I'm at a total loss. We cleaned out the grinder, found a single stuck bean, but didn't solve anything. Is it just time to replace the burrs? Did something slip when I tightened it for a finer grind? Any thoughts are super appreciated!"

I like drinking a cappuccino every day after my afternoon nap, I've always been using my coffee machine's steam wand, but I recently discovered those automatic electric froth machines.

I got then at a charity shop I volunteered at, they were in a generic box, think xmas/bday display boxes, that had no markings other than a fake bow printed on the clear plastic cover. Box was so cheap and had water damage. Probably some Xmas gift from long ago that has been in grandma's basement for 30yrs truthfully. They were that old and that covered in gas heat residue, from experience lol, but damn do they rock. I've broken so many ""cheap sets"" over they years and it's always the salt one that breaks.

I can't wrap my mind around it truthfully, call be cheap or frugal or tightwad whatever but I have better priorities for my money than that. I'll still definitely be using my electric grinder for store bought beans, but for the occasional splurge of fresh roasted high quality beans I feel it would be silly to waste them by using Ole choppy. So, could I just swap my pepper cprns to a cheap leftover grinder, since I have plenty of those lol, and use this truly quality grinder for beans?

In the afternoons, we'll often take a break and make coffee and talk for a little bit to break up the work day. A few weeks ago, after I ground my beans and started heating my water for a V60, I got paged and had to step away for ~15 minutes. When I came back, I finished making my coffee was amazed at how good it was. It was smoother than any other cup I had ever made and had an extra layer of fruitiness that I hadn't tasted with those beans. I was raving about it and wondering aloud about what I could have done differently to make it so amazing when they started laughing harder and harder. Eventually, between their laughs, they revealed that they spent the 15 minutes I was away taking turn blasting ass gas on my ground coffee. 

I was pissed and stormed off, but as time as passed, I can't stop thinking about how good the cup of coffee was. I tried replicating every other aspect of the cup of coffee (leaving the ground coffee resting for 15 minutes, double heating the water, aromating it myself, etc), but nothing did the trick. It's been a couple of weeks now, and I really want to make a cup of coffee that good again. I'm thinking that the only thing left for me to try is get them to gas the grounds again, but I have no idea how to approach it. I'm scared that if I bring it up to them again, I'll never be able to live it down, but the coffee is calling me.

So I’ve had a Baratza Encore for a little over a year and it’s been great. I’ve typically used it for my drip machine but have been getting more into v60 and Chemex style pour overs over the last couple of months.

Typically there’s quite a good amount of fines in my v60 cone after my brew, occasionally so much that the surface is shiny and sleek.

0,"[Question] I kind of prefer under extracted coffee? So I've only recently gotten into coffee, a couple of weeks ago I bought a couple bags of specialty coffee, and one of them is by far the best I've ever had. The thing I found weird about it is that it tasted noticeably salty, which I found odd because I've never heard it used to describe coffee, so I looked it up and apparently it's a clear sign of under extraction. After that I grounded it finer and steeped it for longer, and sure enough, the saltiness went away, but the coffee tasted really generic. I wonder if it's some specific property of the coffee that I'm drawn to. It's a medium roast from Peru, described as having a medium acidity and I brew it using an Aeropress. I figured it might be the acidity that I liked, but I've tried a highly acidic coffee and I found it pretty gross.
I also should add that the original, salty coffee was brewed with 90C water, a 90sec steep and fairly fine grind, while the second cup was at 93C with a 2 minute steep."

The title is referencing Scott Rao's most recent [Instagram post]( where he talks about his favorite coffees of the year and why coffee is in a rough state (I will copy the text of the post in the comments below.) The majority of the post is referencing Scott's disdain for the explosion of new experimental roasting processes (funky anaerobic natural processed coffee) and how it blunts the nuance of coffee. Additionally, coffees processed this way should not score score as high as the do due to the lack of a clean profile.

I wanted to make this post to see what the folks here think of the state of coffee moving into 2022, and whether funky naturals are a fad or will become more popular. My (completely subjective and limited) observation is that many of the coffees referenced in the weekly ""What have you been brewing this week?"" threads are these funky natural coffees and people love talking about them. I personally think they are interesting and enjoyable for 1 cup then I'm exhausted of drinking it, preferring to move onto a more clean washed coffee. I'd love to hear what you all think!"

We both play animal crossing and he admired Broosters coffee makers, I thought it would be a sentimental and thoughtful gift for someone who now finds recreational joy in the kitchen like I do. So I was looking at the same ones, but irl and online. 

I’ve been looking at some “new in box” vintage ones and some that are “new” new but not from any recognizable brand. Like ones off Etsy that are probably from China. 

Do any of you use these? How do you like them? I also found a vintage electric model of the same type of brewer. Maybe that would be a convenient and easy start for someone who’s still learning? There’s a dial for heat settings which is so nifty!

They’re a bit pricey, I guess because they aren’t common anymore and because of the vintage nature of a lot of them. If it makes good coffee though in game! I can’t afford to buy a full on espresso machine yet, unless I get a $40 one from target which I don’t know if I trust or not. Maybe it would just be worth it to get an in between of the espresso machine since that’s what he really really wants.

I have been brewing espresso for the past 9+ years with Rancilio Sylvia and Baratza Preciso (original burrs!). I have been roasting beans for the past 4 years or so.

I think the burrs need replacements as I am grinding my beans in the lowest/finest setting to remotely get a 25-sec pour of 2.5 oz. I had done quite a bit of repairs on my own on this grinder thus far (burr holder, drive gear, adjustment ring and motor etc.) :)

I think I might have to replace the burrs on this grinder and not sure if I have the time or energy to do it myself. I got an estimate from Baratza through their grinder repair program and it's roughly USD $170 (for any repairs and burr replacement) including shipping.

Question:

Does it make sense to spend on this grinder or should I get a new grinder and if so, which one? This grinder is used for espresso 99% of the time if that helps. Their Virtuoso+ (are \~$230) looks interesting..

0,"Dimmer Mod Results for Moccamaster KB741 - cross posted in r/moccamaster Conclusion:  
Yes, installing the dimmer does enable longer dispense time.  Also yes, installing the dimmer does reduce brew temperature.  In other words, dispense duration and brew temperature are inversely related.  Results are posted below.

Theory:  
The longer duration of dispense offers a longer time to dissipate heat to the room.  The Moccamaster has an exposed metal arm at the top and generally doesn't have thermally tight brew basket.  Dispensing the same amount of water over a longer period of time allows more of the heat to dissipate into the room.

Observations:  
When brewing at the as-designed flow rate the machine ramped up quickly and held the brew temperature extremely well.  In other words, the machine does what the marketing says it does, and it does it very well.  I have a new found respect for the design of my machine, but also realize its intended purpose may not match my needs.  I'm conflicted because after seeing the inside of the machine I realize what a quality piece of equipment it is.

Recommendations:  
I can't recommend pursuing this modification as tested.  The triac I tested was a $6 model from Amazon and it is controlled by a potentiometer.  Perhaps you have a different idea such as a micro-controller to operate a triac instead of my $6 potentiometer controlled triac.  But if you were going to go that far, you'd still need to address the problem with heat loss/brew temperature.  Furthermore, as suggested by others in the forum you could get better performance with respect to adjustable brewing from an off-the-shelf machine like the Bonavita or Breville.

Experiment:  
Dispense 1000g (yes, I weighed it) across various triac settings.  Record the time and temperature at every 100g dispensed (10 data points per brew).

Results:  
The amount of control ranged drastically in a rather narrow amount of knob rotation, thus there isn't sufficient precision for this to be reasonable.  The machine was completely incapable of dispensing water with the potentiometer set 100 degrees rotation, even after allowing to ""warm up"" for 5 minutes.  For 0-50 degrees rotation there basically no difference in time or temperature.  Therefore, you're looking for the entire useful range between 50 and 100 degrees rotation...basically 1/8 turn of a knob...not much precision...

I realize the average and standard deviation are not true representations of the brew because they are not time weighted.  However, the overall conclusion would not change.  It was simply not worth putting in the extra effort to convert everything to time-weighted values since the conclusion remains the same.

The graphs... the numbers 0, 26, 51, and 77 represent degrees of rotation.

0,"How do you fit 15 grams of ground beans into a 2 shot esspresso portafilter basket? I recently began my foray into Espresso with a new DēLonghi EC155. It came with two portafilter baskets, I was under the impression (via the manual) that one is single shot and the other is two shot. Every guide I consulted that discussed making two shot Espresso said that around 15 grams is the amount beans you should use in a doubleshot. But after grinding it to the finest I dare go it always overfills the basket with about a third of it mounding in top. This inevitably leads to grounds spilling all over the counter when tamping and wasting a large portion of the coffee.

I am unsure if I'm just tamping it wrong and should be compressing the beans way more than I currently am. Or if perhaps, despite saying in the manual that the larger basket is fit for 2 cups of coffee, it is only a single shot basket.

For now I'm just using about 10.5 grams or so to avoid loosing so much coffee, but I'm worried this is affecting my learning of proper tamping if there is too little coffee. Anyways thanks in advance for any advice, I appreciate it."

Bit of a backstory, my beloved Oxo electric kettle broke on Christmas after three years of daily service. My girlfriend got a high end electric tea kettle that doesn't have a gooseneck, but is quite expensive, and I don't want two kettles cluttering up my kitchen counter. So, I figured that I might just get a regular pour over kettle: I'm not running a cafe, so I could easily live with some 300ml or 500ml device that hides away in my cupboard when I'm not using it.

However, all the product I'm looking up are not convincing me. First, there are very few options, as Amazon and other sites take my search and just give me electric or stovetop kettles. And second, those that do show up seem like they are of poor quality: they're so cheap that I'm skeptical they have great craftsmanship or are made of good materials, and the designs of them seem flawed just by looking at them, such as no cover or lid to prevent heat loss or a metal handle attached very close to the container holding near boiling hot water.

So, any thoughts? Do you have any suggestions or products you'd recommend? Is this a fool's errand and there is no good single serving non-stovetop, non-electric pour over gooseneck kettle?"

Until I started to use my ember, I had no awareness I was drinking ‘cold’ coffee, and how much the taste changed as the temperature was dropping. How do you keep coffee hot while drinking? Have you ever noticed a drastic change in taste as the temp lowered? Should this get more attention or is it just me?"

However, being firmly in my 30s, I have to say that I can't drink like I used to without paying the prince a few hours later. I used to think specialty coffee was way too expensive to drink regularly. However, here's my new rationale for splurging : 

Sipping a nice cup of fancy specialty coffee on the weekend gives me that interesting mouth feel and taste experience that I love from aged brown liquor without feeling like shit the next morning.

0,"Help me debug my brews Hi Guys!

I am relatively new to specialty coffee. I am trying various coffees to experiment with flavors and perfect my brews.

However, I am running into the same problem most of the time: the coffee comes out flavorless, or with very little flavors. I play around with the grind size / dose, but it's very hard to get something consistently flavorful. 

I am using a Barataza Encore with a Clever Dripper. 

I am trying to get the coffee to taste like I tasted it in a coffee tasting at the roaster's, so I have a pretty good idea of what it tastes likes (saying this I have two coffees in mind, but I have tried coffee from other roasters and run into the same issue). 

My default recipe (ie, starting point) is the following:

\- 13g/200g (my scale is not .1g accurate, so potentially slight differences there)

\- Coffee ground at setting 14 on the encore (going lower does not affect the brew positively, it starts being astringent)

\- Water @ 212F/100C

\- Pour all the water

\- Pour all the grounds

\- Gently submerge the coffee

\- At 2 mins 50, break the crust 

\- When done and water settled, start emptying.

I am using standard melitta #4 filters, filtered tap water. 

At this point, the only variables different from the roaster's  is the water, the grind itself and maybe the filters, but I am unsure if this would have a significant difference. I have tasted this recipe (or something very close) at the roaster's with two different coffees, where the flavors were clear and pronounced. 

Right now I am drinking a washed ethiopian. I have not tasted this one at the roasters. Yesterday it was deliciously sweet, and I could definitely taste the various flavors. This morning, it was just flavorless coffee.

I am expected to receive a Third Wave water kit, to see if this makes a significant difference. 

What else could be the result of my flavorless coffee? What can I change? I have tried various grinds, ratios, temperatures... 

Please help :D"
0,"Is this sub is hard/critical on the Fellow Ode? I just got the Fellow Ode, have yet to use it as I'm waiting for some coffee. It's quite the upgrade from what I was using (I won't even name it because it's that bad).

For the price of $300, and the convenience of not adjusting grind size dramatically between espresso and pour over, i thought it was decent?

Based on Hario's spare parts spreadsheet, I was missing a filter which I was able to purchase on the online retailer that shall not be named (could only find replacements in Canada which would have been prohibitively expensive) and found a place to pick up some denatured alcohol for fuel for the burner, but I'm not sure if I'm missing anything else (gasket looks fine).

The Nouveau was produced between 1990-2005; mine was unboxed just chilling in the antique mall where I got it so I'm surprised it even survived 17 years at a minimum, let alone potentially 32, so I'd really like to ID it based on serial numbers or marks, and also see how it ended up near me assuming Hario was not popular during that time period in the Midwestern US.

One full rotation from my zeroed out setting plus rotated to the number 2). I tamped my grounds as I normally would. I was so excited, with everything setup to time and weigh my shot, and after hand grinding for about 15 mins was extremely disappointed in the experience.

0,"I made coffee with RO+bicarbonate only water so you don't have to. I got a package of bicarbonate that is intended to be used with RO 20L water kegs. The recommended dosage is 28g per 20L. I dropped 4.2g into my 1 gallon which threw PPM from 0 to 250 particles. Woosh. Slight overshoot over ideal 100-150ish, but boiling will deposit the rest as scale.

Warmed up the kettle. First I made a cuppa with it. Daimn, the thing looked dark. Didn't drink.

Now, to the coffee. Made an AeroPress (AP) with 12g of extremely lightly roasted PapuaNewGunie. Well, attempted to make one. It got interesting sooner than I expected. First, the champagne-like bloom. It was literally twice as high as the coffee. It looked as if a 6yo was splashing coke into a glass. After taming the foam and squeezing my 200g of water in I moved on with the recipe. Waited the time, turned over, let it settle, presses...  I said pressed... nothing. The air on top would compress trice, but the flow would remain below acceptable for an espresso shot. I turned the AP filter side up only to discover that the filter is sort of clogged and wouldn't even let the air out. So, had to use the shoulders for this one.

And now, the coffee! This is a stripped of any acidity cup of chalk! Velvety smooth, lovely textured, and deprived of any origin taste. It hits the tongue with this clean taste of, well, kettle scale; which proceeds into the cleanliness of watery coffee a nice lovely carrying lady pours into your cup in a diner in a rare good occasion when you want to go for the second one. And finishes, finally, with some good coffee taste. The aftertaste is pretty generic ""I had some not terrible coffee"".

Conclusion: there is a night and day difference between high bicarbonate water and not so much one. 250ppm is not unheard of, my previous apartment had 230ppm cocktail of not only bicarbonate but also god knows what else. My current apartment hovers around 50ppm, which is espresso machine-friendly (pressurized boilers start to deposit scale at around 50ppm), but sometimes makes it hard to tame the acidity."

This setup works perfectly for us  for many years. It is very easy to use and very easy to clean (milk jug goes into dishwasher every night).

Is there a superautomatic that is geared for easy milk drinks with two hoppers? I think the Jura has one but at that price, it’s cheaper to have 2 units.

0,"Clever Dripper vs Aeropress So I have a small, but not unreasonable, collection of brewers including a V60, Kalita Wave and Aeropress. I'm starting to wonder about adding a Clever Dripper or a Hario Switch (although I find it hard to justify spending $50 on yet another brewer, especially knowing I'm clumsy and likely to break the glass), but I keep thinking that conceptually, the Aeropress should produce a similar cup. You're essentially steeping the coffee then pushing it through grounds in a paper filter (although pressure is an added variable here, I would think light pressure wouldn't produce a drastically different result than a draw down). I also realized James Hoffman's brews for Aeropress and Clever Dripper are also pretty similar (2 minute steep time, agitate the water, allow grounds to settle, apply pressure/draw down).

I'm sure someone here has used both. Do they brew a substantially different cup of coffee? If so, do you think pressure is the factor that separates the two, or is there something else?"

Every 30-60 minutes for the next 3-4 hours I have to get up to go piss and by the time I'm done I can't fall back to sleep so it's like, what was the point? (besides the fact that it tastes nice)

This doesn't happen even when I drink a lot of water before bed, it's specifically chamomile that goes straight through me."

1,"Kyusu for one to three: How big should it be? Hello r/tea, I'm a long-time tea drinker but never tried anything other than putting a tea bag in a mug and microwaving it. I want to get more into loose leaf tea and because I like traditional aesthetics, functional design, and hobbies that lend themselves to collecting, I'm looking for a kyusu to start out with and planning in brewing mostly sencha. But I'm finding a lot of confusing information on the ideal size to get.

I get the impression that kyusu run small, but some of the ones I've found that I like are under 150ml which seems ridiculously tiny. My cup alone is 120ml (I am not averse to getting defferent cups of a more appropiate size, though). So, should I aim for a kyusu that will empty in one cup, preventing the leaves from oversteeping? Then if I want more tea I could just make more. Or, should I get a larger one (~300ml) so I have room to share with a friend or 2, and just fill it less if it's just me? Does underfilling affect the flavor? Does size even matter, or just water:leaf ratio? Sorry if this is a lot of questions...

While I'm here, is one kyusu limited to brewing only sencha, or could I brew other types/provenances?"

Instead of getting my Yin Zhen White and Chrysanthemum Pu-erh, I got 150g of loose pine needle tea - which is a lot, lemme tell ya - among other things. I've taken it up with the business; they apologised and will send the correct order, but they've also told me to keep what did arrive as a consolation.

I've never heard of pine needle tea until now. I don't have anyone to give this tea away to, and I feel wasteful just throwing it all away. However I don't want to open it up, find I hate it after the first cup, then have this unopened 150g bag of pine needles just taking up space in my little tea cupboard.

I have been trying to find a tea I like so that I can having something hot to drink (I don’t drink coffee). Got these from Republic of Tea because they let you make a custom mix of single serve teas. I tried them all without sweeteners/milk before adding anything. With that in mind, there were only 4 teas where I finished the whole cup.


Teas I finished with ingredients: **Republic Chai** [Fine Black tea, cinnamon, orange peel, ginger, cardamom seeds, Chinese star anise, cloves and black pepper], **Comfort and Joy** [Fine black tea, cinnamon, natural flavors, cloves, licorice root and apple pieces], **Orange Blossom** [100% White Tea and natural orange and orange flower flavoring], and **Hibiscus Pineapple Lychee** [Hibiscus (flower), rosehips (fruit), apples (fruit), stevia (leaf) pineapple bits (fruit). Other Ingredients: Natural pineapple and lychee flavors].


Teas I Tried That Were Meh: Caramel Vanilla, Orange Ginger Mint, Ginger Peach Green, British Breakfast Blend, Honey Ginseng, Hibiscus Vanilla Apple.


Teas I Hated: People's Green, Double Matcha, Peppermint Bark, Chamomile Rose Tea, Red Velvet Chocolate, Cocoa Coconut, Decaf Apricot, Mango Ceylon, Chamomile Lemon, Good Hope Vanilla, Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice, Peppermint chocolate.

1,"Is herbal tea supposed to taste like water with a bit of toothpaste in it? My first attempt at tea was couple of years ago- it was was Earl Gray. Tasted like extremely watered down toothpaste. Then I learned “oh….you’re supposed to steep these pouches at a specific temperature for a specific amount of time depending on the tea…no wonder it tasted so bad!” 

I randomly decided to try Chamomile a few minutes ago. Used 8 oz. cold filtered fridge water, but my stove only heated it up to 190° (supposed to be 200°). I slowly poured it over the pouch, and let it steep, covered, for about 3.5 minutes as within the recommended range. Again….tasted like a hot cup of water with a bit of mint toothpaste added. 

I heated it back up on the stove to 190°, and let the tea steep for another 2 minutes covered hoping steeping it to the max recommended time would give it full flavor. I am immensely disappointed to find barely any change.  

Is this just what tea is supposed to taste like- well, herbal tea at least? Very watered down? With how popular it is….I honestly expected it to be very flavorful ; delightful….or am I doing everything wrong?"

1,"What is your ""tea schedule""? This was asked four years ago, but I thought I'd re-ask it.

Some questions:

1. What time do you drink tea?

2. What tea do you drink at those times?

3. Do you drink alone or with people?

4. Is your schedule fluid or static?

5. What about your wares?

6. If you don't have a schedule, what is your approach?

My schedule is reasonably simple. I have a bit of a floating bedtime, but I drink two lipton black tea bags three times a day currently. I have mental health needs to change this up now and then, but I take 400mg of caffeine as a fixed max. So currently I have two bags when I wake up, two bags about three to four hours later, and another two at the same interval. I'm gonna be mixing it up after a doctor's appointment tomorrow though, but that's the rough idea. I always drink alone, but I'm typically around my family at some point, so sometimes they're around when I'm drinking.

One of the things I'm looking to get out of being in this subreddit is to branch out from Lipton. To be honest, due to cost, I fully expect Lipton to be the skeleton of my routine, but I'd like to add a floating specialty tea in there now and then. I fully identify as a practical dirtbag tea enthusiast who has two NY Post mugs coming in the mail and loves other cheesy mugs, but I can dig trying new teas as a treat. So depending on caffeine content, I might start throwing that in there at whim as early as next month.

How about you?"

Tbh given the choice between the two I'd rather have the Bigelow 100 pack from Sam's if this one is not reliably available (but I'm not done shopping around if it's not)."
1,"Pulling bubbles out of tea bags- A description of a made up problem and the solutions I found. I may be the only person in the world who cares about this, but just in case anyone else is weird like me, I thought I would share this trick that I figured out.


The discovery of the problem: 


When I studied abroad in the UK (I'm American), I noticed that when I used a tea bag the bag would sink and become fully submerged into the liquid after a minute or two. This was in contrast to my experiences back home where there would always be some air caught in the bag, making it stay afloat the whole while.


The sinking bag appealed to me. Here are the reasons why:


1) I imagined a better infusion was happening (no idea if that's actually true or not).


2) I imagined the tea would cool slightly faster (again, no scientific evidence)


3) I simply liked the aesthetic of that airless bag calmly suspended in the liquid. It usually didn't sink all the way to the bottom, it seemed to have a fairly neutral buoyancy, so it would sit there, mostly vertical, just barely touching the bottom. This is the main appeal of sinking bags, for me. 
A bag full of air sitting all the while on the surface looks messy and unappealing to me compared to the majestic form of an almost neutrally buoyant, airless bag.


The search for a solution:


When I returned home and resumed using my go-to brands of tea I was sad to find none of them would sink. For years I tried tearing tiny holes in the bags to let the air out, which worked, but would often let some leaves out, which was no good.


Now, after years of anguish, I have two great solutions:


1) Straw solution: take a straw and press its business end directly on the air bubble at the top of the floating tea bag. Try to get the whole hole against the bag so that it will sort of seal when you suck. Then, suck a little. You probably won't get all of the air on the first suck, you'll get some of it and then you'll start to get liquid. As soon as liquid is coming through, stop sucking and let the liquid fall back in. Repeat the process until you've pulled most of the air out and the bag sinks. You shouldn't be pulling any liquid up the straw more than a few inches.


2) Turkey baster solution: use a turkey baster instead of a straw. (PREFERRED METHOD)

3) (note: I haven't tried this, but I'm just guessing it will work). A baby ear/nose cleaner/sucker thing. I don't know what these are called. They're like little mini basters used to pull boogers and clumps of ear wax out of baby noses and ears, respectively. If you happen to have a NEW one of these it would probably work great. I think they also might be used for enemas. Again, if you have a NEW one, it will probably work. Use at your own peril if it isn't brand new lol.


And that's it. I was using the straw method for a while and just thought of the baster this morning, which works great and is probably your best option if you have one since they're designed for high heat and you aren't wasting plastic straws (assuming all you have is plastic ones). You can of course reuse the straws many times, but I have a habit of misplacing them so I prefer the baster for now.

Let me know if you have ever considered the floating bag to be a ""problem"" and if any of you actually read this far, lol, thanks! I know this was way, way longer than it should be but I like writing long, drawn out stuff so this post was mostly for me but hopefully it proves useful to at least one weirdo like me."

I like brewing with lots of water and having the tea become more and more tannic and dark and also cooler as I sip slowly over the course of an hour. Not exactly delicate, but I enjoy it. I like seeing the color of the tea too, so clear is a must. 

The one caveat is that I hate double walled cups. In my experience they're always incredibly delicate and I don't want my tea insulated. I like it when it gets to that slightly lukewarm temperature haha. 

The other one caveat is that the mug has to be big. Like 12-16 oz. This has been hard to find. I've been thinking of just using a beer stein, but I'm not sure if those will respond well to heat. 

If realize the above is picky, but if anyone has any recommendations for a large clear mug that is uninsulated, I would love you forever."

1,"Has anyone heard of ""Grade A"" tea for pu'er? I love sticky rice and saw a sticky rice pu'er tea on a website with no reviews so I gave it a shot and ordered it. The tea was just very normal tasting and didn't really impress me.  

However, the website mentions that this tea is ""Grade A"" tea: ""Pu’er tea oranges come in distinct grades, ranked by quality. This premium Grade A pu’er tea is aged for 9 years, and smooth and mellow to drink.""

which sounds great, but I've never heard of any grading system with Grade A in it. I've looked around a little and was unable to find anything, but I'm not very knowledgeable about the topic in general. This makes me kind of suspicious of the tea, as now I'm not sure if their claims are real. Does anyone have some insight on this?"

1,First time trying loose-leaf tea: What-cha order + Questions 
1,"I just realised how much kettles impact the taste of your tea. A few days ago I posted about my enjoyment for tea going down. But this week, I was at my parent's, and really enjoyed every single cup I had. Back at home, it tasted bad again. 

I now know it's not tea, but my gear!

About two months ago I switched to bottled water, to have the best quality water possible. It tasted better for sure, but overall, my cups were getting less and less enjoyable. Also, I get my tea from a local teashop, who import their teas and make their own blends, so I'm sure about the quality too.

The problem was my kettle : an old (at least 13 years old) plastic kettle, with iron tubes at the bottom to heat the water. I used a clean saucepan to boil my water, and (spoiler alert) it was fantastic.

Why is it that my kettle impact the taste so much? I should precise that the kettle is very clean, I take good care of it. Any recommendations for a better kettle (I'm a student so my budget it really low)"

How is that possible to go from being crazy about tea and drinking 5 cups of day, too now not being able to finish my cup ?"

So then I decided to try get my hands on a nicer tea and with my Christmas tea order from white2tea (they have a few non pu erh teas I really enjoy). I got “Waffles” and I also got a free sample of their 2020 “old reliable”.

I tried the old reliable first and somehow it’s still fishy. Did I get bad tea again? It’s definitely a lot better than my first attempt but still unpleasant. Is the fishy taste just something I need to get used to or am I just terrible at choosing pu erh?"

We did some test purchases online over the years but it was always kinda dodgy and questionable for consumtion after inspection.

Recently, I wanted to make my own tea at home and try different blends for infusing. My wife threw a huge tantrum at me because according to her, ""only poor people drink tea like that"", and the only real way to drink tea is to use the tea bags, and that I am just going to ""get scammed and end up wasting money on nothing"". Apparently, since she is from Sri Lanka she claims that everyone there who drinks tea only uses tea bags, that only the poorest of the poorest people would drink loose leaf because it is cheaper to buy.

After I explained to her how loose leaf is the way that tea is brewed in most Asian cultures and is actually the proper way to do it and has been so for centuries, she continued to say that ""those Asians must be very poor to be doing that"". 

Anyway, she obviously wouldn't listen to me, so I guess it's better if I ask more experienced people."

I recently found an old bitcoin wallet from 2014 on an old hard drive that i had completely forgotten about, which is now worth a lot of money, and I want to use a big part of it to pay for material goods in the now, instead of hoping for some crypto future, I'm a little suspicious of all that crypto stuff. 

Does anyone know of any tea store that takes btc as payment? Have you used it yourself? Specially interested in those that can take direct bitcoin transfers not just bitpay or such, but that's also ok.

Even if the web store not in english (chinese is no problem) it's fine as long as they can send to Sweden.

I'm mostly into higher oxidised rolled oolongs, and high roast tieguanyin, and also light green unroasted oolongs, but mostly to give to friends and family who like those a lot. Also some black tea like fujian blacks with slight dried longan aroma like zhengshan xiaozhong, jin jun mei, golden monkey."

In it one of the richer clan members makes a point of saying ""This tea is stale."" -looks to be light in color, probably green tea. I wondered if this is actually possible? Or is it a funny thing added to show both how spoiled the character is as well as an inside joke as the tea can't actually go stale?

Recently I switched coffee for green tea and I am loving it, however, I have a small concern.

It is a widely known fact that green tea isn't supposed to be brewed in a boiling water, but rather in a 70-80 Celsius degrees water.

Now, when I boil the water and pour it into my mug (regular sized mug) how long do I need to wait for the water to cool down to those 70-80 degrees?

Regular room temperature about 23 Celsius. 

Anyone knows this, I would be grateful? Thanks 😊"

I have been drinking specialty coffee for years and my appreciation for it has driven me to dive into the world of tea. I have ordered about $60 worth of loose leaf, single origin teas that seemed nice from Adagio (I ordered a mix of Green, Black ; Oolong Teas) as well as a classic tea brewing set for gong fu style tea. That being said, how would you all suggest I go about trying different teas, especially blends of tea once I have the single origin flavors figured out? I really want to expand my palette and find a variety of excellent tasting teas. Currently I use a subscription through Trade Coffee that lets me try tons of different brands of coffee that are almost always great quality.

We've been thinking of adding Kam's brother MannGoe into our Medley, a ManGoMeal segment for our brew would make it fruity.

Not so sure about Lee'Mon, cause he's a Ginger and has a small Rooibos. A little sour as well, but some sugar ought to give his Bigelow a Lemon Lift.

She's gone cold and bitter, overbrewed. Can't even get hot enough for an English Breakfast.

My wife may catch me having my regular Camo-Meals, she'll remain Grey about whats boiling over at the Kettle. Earl knows but he's a Cast-Iron kinda guy, we hope he doesn't tell my wife's sister.

1,"Looking for matcha recommendations--specifically from Kettl, but open to others For some background, I don't drink a lot of matcha straight up, but love a matcha latte (doesn't have to be sweetened) or matcha pastries/cookies/creams etc. I love the experience of trying new teas even if I don't end up loving the teas themselves, but with matcha especially it seems like such a waste if I only try one serving and end up not liking it-- so, I tend to order it when I'm out and about, and subsequently haven't really kept track of the qualities I've liked or disliked. 

So anyway, I bought my mother some of Kettl's matcha-white-chocolate-coated-almonds as a present, just tried one myself and was totally blown away by the matcha they use. I honestly feel like I could drink it every day and be blown away every single time. 

The label specifies their Hukuju matcha, which is currently sold out, so if you've liked any matchas from Kettl specifically, I'm looking for recs (but I'm also open to other vendors, like Ippodo)-- what are some matchas you really love, and why do you like them? 

As far as matchas I've tried straight up, in case anyone else has also had these:   
\- I wasn't a fan of What-cha's Wazuka Samidori, which I found a touch bitter.   
\- I liked Postcard Tea's Uji matcha prepared as usucha; I found it quite balanced and smooth.   
\- I get on well with Mei Leaf's Master's matcha as usucha or koicha; I like how sharp and clear it is.   
\- As I mentioned above, Kettl's Hukuju matcha (at least in combination with the almonds) was mind-bogglingly delicious and I need more of it in my life. 

Looking forward to hearing about, and hopefully trying, some of your favorite matchas!"

1,"Is tea supposed to be super bland?? I havent ever had black or green tea and dont plan to because of religious reasons. I'm REALLY interested in tea, though! So I've been trying herbal teas. The problem is: they dont taste like ANYTHING?

I'm using teabags since I'm a newbie—pukka elderberry and echinacea, teavana spiced apple cider, and pukka chamomile vanila and manuka honey. They have good reviews online so clearly people enjoy them! 

I use filtered water from the fridge. I bring my water to a boil, warm up my mug with extra water then dump it out, and immediately add it to the teabag. I follow the package instructions of infusing for 10-15 min, depending on the tea. I use less than 8oz of water (so I only fill up my mug halfway basically). I even doubled up on the elderberry one, hoping it would make a difference. 

The teas are always fragrant and colorful (apart from the chamomile which is just yellow), but they dont taste like anything. Just hot water. Is this normal? I have no idea what I could be doing wrong. I really enjoy the aroma of the teas, so I'm still enjoying the experience. The teavana apple cider had the most taste, but it basically tastes like oatmeal to me because the flavors are so subtle and bland lol. 

Is herbal tea just not as flavorful as black tea and other popular teas? Is it just supposed to be fragrant hot water? I plan on investing in higher quality tea in the future, but I'm wondering if this is just how tea tastes. (Side note: I've been experimenting with adding just a bit of milk or creamer or stevia, and it HAS helped me enjoy my tea more)"

1,"Powered Teas Other Than Matcha We all know about matcha, and I like matcha, but I’m looking for other ideas on those days where I’m feeling lazy and just want to add power. A lot of what I see has sugar or artificial sweeteners, and that’s not what I want in my tea. I hope that doesn’t sound snobby, but if I want sweetened tea, I’ll add honey. 

I have matcha, golden milk mix, black cocoa, and cacao. Black cocoa and matcha is my favorite quick mix. Black cocoa has a slight Oreo taste…well, if Oreos didn’t have sugar.

What do you all like?"
1,"Turtle Dove 12/15 novice review Today was my first time trying Turtle Dove from White2Tea. This was a free 7g sample coin included with my puer order.

Turtle Dove is a white tea that is often given as a sample, and is advertised as an easy and forgiving tea, regardless of the brewing method. This sample is either from the 2018 or 2019 batch.

My session stats:
- Tea ratio: 7g/90ml (~1g/13ml)
- Number of infusions: 8
- Infusion rate: 10s/+5s
- Temperature: 212F/100C

First, I rinsed the coin in my teapot with boiling water for 20 seconds to decompress the leaf. I did not taste the rinse tea, but it did smell nice. The first few infusions tasted similar, but the flavor began to mellow out by the fifth infusion.

There was a moderate amount of broken leaf pieces in the pitcher when pouring, but I attribute that to breaking the coin apart to make it fit in my teapot.

I do agree with the notes given by W2T that Turtle Dove has a nice fragrance, body, and mouthfeel.

Since I am still new to gongfu tea, I couldn’t taste any flavor notes, but my initial impression was that this tea reminded me of Lipton tea for some unknown reason, and I don’t even like Lipton tea. I find that strange because this tea is supposed to have sweet flavor notes, but I didn’t taste any sweetness.

My infusions were darker than I had anticipated, not light like a white tea at all, and that is most likely due to my tea ratio and infusion rate, unless this tea is supposed to be darker.

I have never had white tea before, so I didn’t know if the infusion rate should increase during brewing or stay the same. [This]( is the color of the sixth infusion, brewed for 35 seconds. All the infusions were similar to this color, including the rinse.

Overall, I wouldn’t order this tea for myself since I didn’t consider it a “great” tea, but I would consider trying it again if I were to get another sample in a future order.

If I made any brewing errors with this tea, feel free to correct me because I do have 25g of Nightlife white tea to try."

1,"Easy ways to manipulate water for tea? Rather in depth topic, might not be to relevant for casual drinkers, but I'm at a loss here and need help from the tea-heads out there who are way too deep down the rabbit hole and have experimented with this.

Here's my situation:

I live in germany. Tap water is very good here, low chlorine levels and scale only builds up over moths of use. However, I recently moved and now all my tea tastes rather flat. Even increasing the leaf to water ratio or temperature just yields a thin brew.

I'd like to avoid the classic water filters (Brita Style), because there's a ton of controversy about their effectiveness, most trustworthy reviews give them 3/5 at best and they're expensive.

What are my options here?

* Bottled water. Would take a lot of time and testing to find out which brand I want and depending on the brand it might not be cheap in the long run. Also, I usually consume at least 1L of tea per day, so dealing with all the bottles would be a hassle.
* Other filters. No experience here. RO with adding minerals back afterwards seems like an option, although I'm not sure if I can afford it. Any other suggestions or experiences here?
* Any other ideas on making the best out of tap water? Does leaving it out in a caraffe to aerate do anything? I heard of active charcoal to add ""good"" minerals into the water?

Essentially I'm simply looking for other people who already have experience with making the best out of suboptimal tap water situations. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated as I don't have the money or time to try everything out myself (Need the money to buy more tea xD)

Thank you in advance."

* Dragon Well
* Genmaichai
* Matcha
* Matcha Iri Genmaichai
* Mao Feng (Any region)
* Silver Needle
* Assam
* Breakfast Assam (CTC)
* Lapsang Souchong
* Milk Oolong
* Darjeeling 1st/2nd flush
* Ceylon
* Honey Orchid Oolong (Rare Dark Oolong)
* Taiwanese Oolong
* Tie Guan Yin Oolong
* Yunnan Pu-erh
* Japanese Sencha
* Chinese Sencha
* Bilouchun 
* Gunpowder Green
* Iron Goddess (Tieguanyin)
* Keemun
* Da Hong Pao
* *Any other black, oolong, green, white, yellow and fermented teas you have!*

Pictures can be of the leaves themselves or brewed teas in whatever vessel you choose. Photos of teaware are welcome.

Please do keep in mind, I can't offer anything in the way of remuneration for your pictures. However, I will send everyone who participates a free copy of the book (paperback or PDF depending on my budget at the end of the project).

I look forward to seeing all your delicious teas!

I’m looking to buy a Yixing teapot, but I’ve heard it can be hard to find a legit supplier and I’ve also heard that Yixing produced after a certain year isn’t _actualllly_ Yixing. These teapots can also be astronomically expensive, so I don’t want to buy something that’s hundreds of dollars only for it to not really be Yixing. 

So I’m wondering if there are any reputable dealers to buy a Yixing teapot from? I don’t mind a more expensive pot, but I’d like to stay below $200 if possible. If that’s not reasonable, then so be it. Also, any tips on making sure you’re getting the real deal if you are buying something online?

1,"Does yixing clay type actually matter when pairing a tea? When I first got into tea, the type of yixing clay was sacred and using tea with the wrong tea type was sacrilege. The color of the tea dictated, more or less, the type of clay used. Shu puerhs went in dark zisha, while whites (if you must) can go in duan ni. Never, *never*, do the opposite. 

So my question is, does it really matter? Can you brew an heavily roasted oolong in a yellow duanni clay pot?  Does it really matter all that much?"

I come seeking your wisdom and aide. I am a Secret Santa for a tea snob and I know next to nothing about tea other than that throat coat tea is wonderful for a cold and we threw a bunch in a harbor to thumb our nose at a king. My limit is $40. Is there anything that I could get that would impress her and, vicariously, my girlfriend's friends? Any guidance or specific recommendations on tea or tea-adjacent items you could give are greatly appreciated.

**Potentially Relevant Details:**

* Bay Area, California
* GF tells me ""Classics are fine (earl grey, oolong, jasmine, darjeeling, etc.) She ordered a strawberry tea at the tea party, so any fruity or citrus tea would be good.""
* Tea party looked very British/Mad Hatter themed.

**Context:**

My girlfriend's friends group does a Secret Santa every year and I've been invited to participate. Unfortunately, I was assigned probably the most difficult person to purchase gifts for. (My girlfriend laughed at me when I told her who my giftee was and said ""Good luck!"") All I know is that she is a big fan of tea and is... fairly particular when it comes to tea and tea accessories. The ladies have attended swanky tea parties before and my giftee has deemed $400 teapots insufficient for her needs. 

A good rule of thumb is to not buy gifts related to a hobby someone is passionate about because you will quite often get it wrong. For example, never buy Beats by Dre for an audiophile. But, since I have no choice, I am determined to get it right and impress her friends with my gift giving acumen. The only problem is that I am out of my depth.

Thank you all ahead of time for your kindness."

What teas do you brew that way? 

I've been enjoying some rolled oolongs and pu'er samples that way, it's been going really well! 

 For those who haven't heard of it: grandpa style is when you just put the leaves in the cup with the water (no strainer/infuser). This works best for tea with whole leaves, not tiny pieces of leaves that'll float (like rooibos). If you're wondering ""how do you avoid drinking the leaves?"", you can blow on the tea and that can move the leaves, you can use a spoon to drink it, and sometimes the leaves will sink to the bottom and stay there."
1,"Super excited to get this cool Taiwanese oolong sampler, wanna tell you all about it for anyone else is really into oolongs : ) + mini review One of my favorite oolong vendors is [Mountain Stream Teas]( , only found out about them a few months ago but I was immediately impressed with all the info they have on their site for most of their teas (elevation, cultivar, region, oxidation, method of processing, agrochemical status, ect.,). I bought some oolong from them ( [sweet ; rich fall pear mountain oolong]( ) and I really loved it! Just wanted to let y'all know they have a [sampler for all 3 harvesting seasons]( and it looks really good! If you enjoy rolled, Taiwanese oolongs I'd definitely recommend it because the fall harvest was amazing! 

Here's a mini review of the sweet oolong and rich oolong from their fall harvest for more context:

Sweet: This one tastes a ton like pear!! The tea is juicy and sweet with a lovely, strong flavor and it's lightly floral. The leaves of both of them are nice and whole and they look beautiful when they unfurl. This tea is a lovely bug bitten tea, which means that it was grown agrochemical free to allow bugs to bite it which makes the leaves sweeter! The color is a nice light yellowish.

Rich: Like the name suggests, this one is much richer, noticeably buttery, but it still holds some of that yummy pear taste! Its broth is a bit darker, but not by much. 

Both of these teas are so good, I can't pick a favorite. Only downside imo is that to really get the best flavor it's best to let them rest for 3-4 weeks after opening before brewing. They're awesome oolongs, so I'm excited to get the 3 season sampler and compare! Anyone else who loves Taiwanese oolongs and is willing to pay a bit for them should check it out to see if it sounds good to them! : ) Just wanted to share, if any of you have had the fall harvest lmk what you thought too!"
1,"Most remarkable tea flavor you've ever tasted? Some teas taste like flowers, fruit, smoke, wood, minerals, grass, and other things. The way tea (Camellia sinensis) can taste like so many different things is amazing, what's the most unique/remarkable taste you've gotten from tea? For me a few come to mind: I had a naka pu'er that tasted like a meadow, a dancong oolong that tasted like flowers and honey, and a jin jun mei that tasted like hay and menthol. Curious about what other people have tasted : )."

It occured to us that lemon is a lot like cranbe bit arry after i put way too much into a smoothie with dandyblend and made it into a gnarly smoothie beer. So i thought like hey cranberry is like potent like lemon. What if i made a nice cranberry and honey with all this gnarly cranberry. So i put 1 scoop 5ml of honey with a splash of cranberry into a owl teacup up to 2 cups of temperate comfortably sippable water. It was not quite sweet enough so i put 5 more ml in and it sweetened it up. Hey do whatever you like man put 1 scoop or two. Or three who knows. Im adding a mint leaf as a garnish to grind my teeth with and feel the cool freshness. Hey so theres a lemon and honey and cranberry and honey. Its a way to use that gnarly cranberry juice. Best wishes from the spiritual chefs. Gnarly easy teaing folks.

Big time bourbon and scotch drinker and I need to transition into another drink related cerebral hobby otherwise i'll drink myself into a poor bill of health. 

I want to get into tea so that it scratches the itch I get from sampling different scotches, analyzing notes, flavor profiles etc. 

I prefer more robust tasting things with smoke/ ash profiles (tough with the tea world I know). Heard of oolongs and am interested in that whole culture but I like to drink at night and can be sensitive to caffeine.

Would appreciate some comments on how to navigate through this world or even a quick guide on what teas to get into, what categories of teas exist, etc.

1,"A Bit about Discovering Pu'erh I’m not new to tea but new to pu'erh. My first experience was a fishy loose pu'erh. Meh. Later I saw and appreciated /u/LiquidProustTeas post about his annual sampler to help broaden our experience of pu'erh.

The LP sampler arrived in early December—a plethora of mystery envelopes. For, essentially, the price of shipping cost, there was a ton of tea. 

The envelopes offered little information with scribbles such as ""2014 Jinggu,"" ""2010 Gushu,"" ""2012 Honey Fragrance.""

It took me a while to figure out how to brew at 6500F. Water boils at a lower temperature where I live. I began with 185F and hated nearly all the samples I tried. I've figured out to leave less water in my tea kettle and bring the temperature up to 200-212F with better results.

(Keeping a pu'erh journal to log each tea and my reaction to it has been valuable.)

I experimented with temperatures and ""flash steeps"" during the last month before settling on what works for me, always starting with a 3-5 sec rinse.

By the end of December, I'd learned a lot about how to brew and steep. I feel this is a very personal process, so I'm not going into detail about it. Like tea itself, what works for me, may not work for you.

Initially, only one pu'erh stood out:  2005 Changtai. Wow. Fantastic. This mystery pu'erh continues to stand out for me.

But... I've been going back over all the samples, taking more time/days with each of them, realizing my first reactions were poorly informed, poorly brewed, or steeped.

Today, a tea I'd dismissed after a couple of sips is quite interesting:  2015 Naka Shou. Once I got past the hay/barn steeps, there's a sweetness that lingers in later steeps.

So... for those like me who are genuinely new to pu'erh, I can't recommend the LP sampler enough when Andrew offers it again. Other vendors provide samplers, too. I expect to be sampling between LP and other vendors for a long time.

Also, if you're new to pu'erh as I am:  take your time. Experiment with your tastings, and revisit those you thought were ""bleh"" when you first tasted them. I've been pleasantly surprised, and I'm not even near done experimenting.

I'm on day 3 of the 2015 Naka Shou. :)

1,"Recommendations for Porcelain Teapots With a Strainer Rather Than Infuser? Hi all, been looking on Google for something that fits the criteria in the title but it's obviously been hard to find many teapots that specific. I found a $60 Maeda En teapot that fits the bill but was wondering if anyone knew of something cheaper or had a specific teapot they could vouch for. 

I'm more interested in one with a strainer rather than an infuser because I have some Japanese green teas and rolled oolongs that I've heard need room to expand. Would a large enough infuser work well enough or is no infuser still best?

I also specifically want porcelain for ease of cleaning and price compared to cast iron or traditional clay kyusu. I'm new to teapots so if stainless steel is also easy to clean and cheap then that'd be fine too.

1,"Im having trouble getting sharper notes out of my tea I have a jin jun mei and a silver needle, and they both taste incredible with great aromas. But the first time I had ordered them my brews had much sharper hay-like, sweet notes. The infusions much more resembled the smell of their unbrewed downy buds the first time I bought them. The brews im getting now are well rounded, but I got these two teas for the sharpness on their sweeter notes.

I know im using the same temperature of water, because I wrote it down from last time I bought these teas. Im wondering how I should tackle troubleshooting my brews. Should I focus more on experimenting with brew times, or leaf to water ratio? Id say right now im using a 3 or 4 to one water and bud ratio by eyeballing the volume with a 3 to 5 second total brew time

Could this just be a symptom of the buds mellowing out over time in the vendor's storage? The last time I bought them was a year ago during the late spring and summer, right around a bit before they would be harvested. The teas come from a smaller company, that may be still getting through their stock of last year's harvest."

For example, I just got a hold of some silver needle tea from O5 and I’m brewing it as recommended in western style (4 g tea and 240 g of 75 C water, steeped for 4 minutes). I understand that, unlike coffee, tea can be re-steeped and re-enjoyed and was wondering what variables I should change in subsequent brews to improve my experience.

1,"Cup suggestions Hi peeps, first of all, hope you had an awesome Christmas and happy upcoming new year in advance! 

I am looking for your advice😊 

The other day was walking in town and noticed a teashop (I guess its new, maybe not, never noticed it before tbh 😁) and was like - why not step in? Walked out with three packs of tea and a cast iron teapot. 

Now I am faced with a dilemma. I love the pot but I feel that my average mugs don’t really cut it (favourite mug is this big dog-head shaped thing with ears). Especially if I want to serve it to guests (I still use the dog mug, dont worry 😁). 

They do have cast iron cups in the shop that would match the teapot perfectly, but I tend to drink either black tea 80-100c or green tea that you heat up at 70-80c and feel, that I will just end up burning myself with those cast iron cups 🤔I know I can let it stay in the cup for five minutes to cool down, but I am not lukewarm tea fan (especially during colder weather).  

So wondering if you guys might suggest some interesting/cool cups that would look good with the teapot. I prefer minimalistic, not too bright stuff. But if you have some awesome super bright and colourful set that would definitely change my mind, or you just want to show off tour 300 yo Chinese set, then feel free to throw it in as well 😁

1,"Preparing loose leaf tea I recently bought a Basilur loose leaf Cream Fantasy because I loved the bag so much. Thing is: whenever I prepare it it doesn't get to the same level of taste and specially aroma as the tea bag did. Should I expect a downgrade or could I be doing something wrong? 

I prepare it by leaving it as the same temperature as I did the bag (around 70ºC), and then I put 1 tsp of leaves into the water in a pan. Wait for 2 minutes, do a little mixing with a spoon and put it in my cup."
1,"Companies that have sample bundles? Reasons why inside I honestly was not expecting so much… tea culture.

So I was like “What if for the new year I try a new tea a day?” That sounds cool right? Expect a lot of the companies that pop straight into my head don’t have like a 24 pack sampler.      
Any ideas? I’m fine with loose leaves or tea bags, just keep in mind that I plan on doing this in the morning before work."

I only started drinking tea that wasn't Southern Style Sweet (yes, I am a Southern) about a year and a half ago.

I'm not very sold on green teas as of yet, but can be convinced to try anything once.   


(Part of the reason I'm not sold on green teas, is every tea shop I've been to where I've ordered one, even after allowing to steep, the tea always just tasted like hot water, not even subtle taste notes.  Matcha being the only exception. So I want to chalk it up to bad restaurant not bad tea.)

1,"Hey Tea drinkers! Is it possible to make a caffeinated, keto, chai tea (water + heavy whipping cream)? I’m a heavy diet soda drinker, but I need a lifestyle change. I’ve never drank or cared for tea and I’m not looking to remove caffeine.

I need a new “go-to” drink, and it needs to be sugar free / keto, or at least reasonably close, or the sugar alone is going to kill me.

One time, someone made me a dark, creamy, “chai tea” though I know he added tons of stuff to make it awesome, and it rocked.

I don’t know why I haven’t experimented with this before, but it seems I could get a keurig cup or something similar for chai tea, brew it in water, and add heavy whipping cream. This might give me a creamy, keto, and delicious tea that would be perfect! But there’s a dozen little questions I have as a non-tea drinker I’m hoping you folks can help me with.

Does chai tea exist in keurig form? Is it just as easy to brew it some other way? (I don’t at all mind investing in a solution, if this is going to be a go-to drink let’s optimize it and make life easier).

Does chai usually have caffeine in it? Do I need to supplement the caffeine if it doesn’t? Can anyone recommend any masala chai brands that do have caffeine?

I assume some tea drinkers probably supplement caffeine and there’s a super easy way.

If I’m just doing tea brewed in water + heavy whipping cream, are there any other magic spices or additives I should consider? Like keto powered cinnamon?

Do any of you guys do keto and maybe you’ve solved a similar need? Did this work?

I’m actually excited, this seems like a new possibility in the drink universe! I’ve never been a coffee drinker either but there’s a genuine FOMO when you see people sit down cupping a giant hot cup in 2 hands and taking a sip. It looks so cozy, but I never want to drink anything that would go in that cup before."

1,"Soup tea / savory tea / sipping broths In Japan there is a long standing tradition (dating back to the early 20th century) of drinking a broth made from kelp seaweed (called kombucha, and likely where the name of the fermented tea kombucha originated….some mix up in translation somewhere). 

Kombucha (kelp version) is also traditionally available flavored with Japanese plum (ume, pronounced oo-meh), and we have some products with matcha mixed in. The Japanese don’t drink it as a soup, though it could be one. They sip it as a tea. “Sipping broth” actually sounds better than “soup tea” perhaps….

But I noticed David’s Tea attempt a line of soup teas in 2017. It no longer exists so I assume they couldn’t get people interested, but maybe the marketing wasn’t done right…or the price point.

Did anyone try David’s Tea’s version? I’ve always wondered what would happen if you took dried vegetables and blended it into umami rich Japanese green teas. Or smoky roasted teas. It’s something I want to experiment with in 2022."
1,"Brewing larger amounts of loose leaf Japanese teas? I'm getting into Japanese teas and have been getting several types from ippodo (sencha, gyokuro, bancha, etc), and I recently purchased an electric kettle with different temperatures so I can follow the instructions for proper brewing, also I am looking into getting a kyusu teapot.

So coming from a background of just brewing large amounts of black/early grey type teas for myself or multiple people in fairly large mugs, I'm wondering how can you brew larger amounts of tea using a kyusu? Should I just avoid a kyusu and brew more tea at a time if I steep longer per extra oz of water?

I know I can just have hot water ready and just fill a whole kyusu up for one mug if I have to, then refill it again for another, but wouldn't this only work 3ish times before I need to change the leaves? I'd imagine if that is the case I'd be doing a lot of 'labor' and also run out of tea fast.

Also I'm fine with using traditional green tea cups (which I'll likely purchase), but I know I would be refilling them quite a few times so the same question still stands.

Thanks for any advice, I'm pretty new to all this and appreciate any help!"

1,"Matcha Lattes Tips? I have two problems - TLDR:

1. Matcha is bland
2. Foam collapsing

I've been trying all sorts of methods to make a matcha latte but I can never figure it out. I like Starbucks' Pure Matcha Latte (which is different from the regular matcha latte and probably not available in other countries) and some other cafes, and even then it is a hit or miss. 

I use a matcha powder of a grade somewhere between culinary and ceremonial. Usually barista grade or something similar.

;#x200B;

**Bland Matcha Problem**

I've tried with 50ML of water, 2 teaspoons of powder and 150ML of milk. I use a chasen for the matcha. I use water probably around 70 degrees C. I think I've even tried 3 teaspoons which is way more than most online recipes and even then, it doesn't taste strong enough or it feels like something is missing. 

I know that Starbuck's Pure Matcha Latte is made with 4 teaspoons of powder for Venti (591ML). That is way less in concentration than what I'm using. How is it so much stronger in taste? I don't really want to spam powder because it's expensive.

I've tried different milks because I thought that may be the problem too. So far I've tried low fat and full fat milk and almond milk. None of them makes a difference although almond one makes it taste like almond which isn't what I want.

;#x200B;

**Foam Problem**

I thought that maybe my latte is missing something because I don't have a good foam. I can't afford those steam wands in coffee machines unfortunately. I use the portable milk foam wand. It always foams way too much but when I use it for a shorter duration, the foam collapses. 

Most annoyingly, **when i mix the foam of the matcha with the foam of the milk, the bubbles start to merge and collapse with the sizzling sound.** It's gross to say the least. Is getting a greenish matcha foam only possible with a milk steaming machine?

When I use the wand on the matcha latte (ie. matcha water + milk mixture) itself, it does not foam well and gives gross bubbles, kinda like soapy water.

If it matters, I microwave my milk to around 50-70 degrees C prior to using the foam wand.

I've tried steeping for longer (like 20 min) and that sort of helped. I'm not sure if I should try using more tea bags or if they maybe used a sweetening agent?

1,"How did tea come into your life? I was a coffee drinker from my junior year in highschool (around 2016) till this past fall. I wasn't drinking coffee every single day, but definitely regularly.

Then, as a result of my poor diet choices, my intestines got very mad at me. I cut out all carbs for two weeks, and I also ended up cutting out coffee because it was giving me indegestion and upsetting my stomach.

I've always wanted to be a tea drinker, and this seemed like the perfect time to try.

I've since fallen in love in tea. I don't do caffeinated teas very often because I'm still sensitive to it, but I enjoy a small mug of green tea occasionally and I ADORE herbal tea. My favorite brand so far is Red Rose. I've tried two Adagio sample boxes as well. It's definitely not going to replace coffee for me, and I have had some decaf coffee as a treat (the acidity still isn't fun but with other aspects of my diet in control I can handle it), but I so enjoy bringing tea to work and talking to people who notice the tea bag string hanging out of my travel mug.

1,"Newbie Question:are certain types (leaf) of tea sweeter? I’ve always liked tea (bags) and tisanes, but recently learned of this sub and decided to start exploring loose leaf tea - it sounds fun. 

I generally like sweeter stuff, but I’m not sure which kind of teas are more sweet vs bitter. I just bought a few samplers with all kinds and I plan to try all kinds regardless if they’re sweet or not to find what I like, but I was curious if some types are sweeter than others? Example, are white/green usually sweeter than black or visa versa or is it entirely dependent on how it’s made rather than the leaf?

Side question: Is it generally considered bad to add things like honey to loose leaf tea? I occasionally like to add honey to tisanes, but was curious if that’s common for tea. 

Just to be clear, I plan to try everything the way it comes without honey and even if it’s not a sweet type and really try to taste the flavors. I was just curious how to hone in on a type I like more as far as flavor. I guess similar to how craft beer will bring specific flavors based on its type and other various factors, are there similar indicators for tea?"

1,"Newbie looking for tea advice. Extensive writeup of what Ive tried below! :) So, I made my New Years resolution a simple one. Cut out the highly caffeinated energy drinks and limit the nightime adult beverage drink. 
So far, morning wise, Ive been having Tazo's English breakfast, lunch I have Harneys chocolate mint, and at night some chamomile flowers with maybe a sprinkling of valerian root. 

This weekend I tried Lapsang souchong from Harneys. Omg its amazing! Im realizing I probably like smokey, malty teas. This morning when I went to make tea, I had English breakfast, feeling like lapsang souchong would maybe be wasted on a morning wake up before work? 

I have a yellow tin of Au Jasmin. The cheap stuff. I like jasmine but its too bitter. It may be my brewing process.  Im probably going to give the tin to a coworker.

Anywho. So I like loose tea, I think I gave a good idea of what ive been drinking and enjoying, and gave yall an idea of my tea schedule. For adult beverages i like scotch, whiskey, bourbon. (To give you flavor ideas)

What other teas (looseleaf please) would you recommend me looking into? For at night I would like something tastey but potentially decaf? Is there a chocolate herbal? How is Harneys chocolate decaf? 
Breakfast wise ive just been using tea bags and would like to order either a loose english, scottish or Irish.  Should I branch out into Oolongs yet?"

1,"How to avoid import costs in Belgium from Chinese packages? I live in Belgium and receive Chinese packages with tea monthly. I am subscribed to the W2T club and also order from W2T and other webshops that ship directly from China.

Until recently I rarely had any issues but then the EU decided to change the rules:

* Before mid '21 packages that were cheaper than € 22 were free from import duty and VAT. This meant that most packages, even the ones more expensive than € 22, were often overlooked.
* After mid '21 all packages coming from outside the EU are subject to import duty and VAT. (This in itself I don't mind, the duty and VAT are usually a couple of euros extra and I also think it's only fair to pay taxes on something just as I do for products I buy within the EU.)

What really bothers me, however, is that Bpost (BE national postal services), which somehow handles all Chinese packages, charges me a flat rate of € 15 per package for handing it over to customs and for dealing with the formalities. They say you can declare it yourself but that this process is complex and time consuming. 

On large orders € 15 is not that much but on small orders and on my club packages this often more than 40% of the cost of the tea. I also recently found out that large orders are being sent divided over multiple packages which means I'm sometimes being charged double.

This makes buying tea directly from China a great deal more expensive and I'm looking for any tips or tricks to avoid these extra costs.

Many thanks!"

So now I am stuck with a box of decafs that are not as good as their caffeinated counterparts: Yorkshire, PG Tips, and Typhoo. The Barry's decaf was the only one I actually liked.

I now know that Barry's decaf, or an Earl Grey (as the bergamot hides the cheap decaffeination flavour), or Rooibos are my go-tos, but I am now stuck with the former boxes of decaf.

I drink them hot plain, or with milk and sugar. Sugar seems to make them taste tolerable."

So I’ve been doing some reading about how to alleviate my anxiety without medication and a lot of recommendations mention drinking tea. 

My issue is, I don’t really like tea but I want to because it seems like an easy and very accessible and discrete way to help my anxiety. 

Does anyone have tips about how to make tea taste good? Or which teas that help anxiety taste the best?

For reference, the only tea I have had that I liked is English Breakfast with half and half and sugar in it.

Her english isn't great, so she's never been able to properly explain why other than than to ""wash off any dust"".

The dry leaves smelled a bit like strawberries and slightly vegetal. I rinsed it first, and steeped it for around 1 minute with roughly 80 °C water. The tea was a nice bright green color and very thick, it tasted almost exactly like cooked spinach with a very slight hint of berries. It had a pretty strong unpleasant bitter aftertaste.

I tried lowering the temperature and time when I re-steeped it, but still couldn't get rid of the bitterness.

It it supposed to taste like this? The flavour wasn't really like anything i've had so far and i doubt I could have even guessed it was tea if i didn't know it! What time and temperature should I use?

1,"Can't taste hot tea very well? Hi there! I was wondering if anyone could help me with an issue I'm having. This is really a constant thing kinda but it's a trend I'm noticing with hot teas. I can't really taste alot of them well, they tend to be lightly flavored water, sometimes spicey if it's got cinnamon or ginger n such in the blend, and that's all fine and enjoyable of course, I still like it but I'm starting to feel a lil.... I guess uncertain?

Going off reviews of a blend, my friends opinions and such I feel like I should be getting a much stronger flavor from alot of the brews I try, we all basically brew our teas the same to our knowledge, I used 2-3 heaped teaspoons (About 6 grams) 8 oz of water just off the kettle (usually unless it needs to be a lil cooler for the tea) and brew for the instructed time in my gravity steeper, the last one I brewed being Salted Caramel Lebukchen from bird and blend, yet the most I'm getting from it is a slight gingery spice, despite the fact others seem to be getting more notes from it?

As a better example, Sticky chai, I brewed that multiple ways and despite the fact others got a lot of spicey and sweet notes, I really just got a kind of milky black tea, helped by honey. Now it was nice don't get me wrong it was alright but not what I feel I should be getting from it?

I've noticed when I cold brew (4-6 teaspoons, 16oz i believe, left overnight) I can much much better tastes the flavors I'm looking for, it's alot stronger and usually quite tasty.

I just genuinely cant tell if there's something wrong with my taste buds, if i'm doing something or if i'm maybe expecting too much.

I was considering trying out matcha as I hear that's got a stronger flavor, that and it just seems interesting. 

And also maybe try Gong-fu as I hear that leads to stronger flavors.

I guess this has turned into a bit of a long rant more than a solid question, and probably me overthinking quite a bit about this, but I thought it might be worth posting to see if I can get any input. If anyone could help with their own personal experience or point in the right direction that'd be nice. Sorry for the long rant hahaha."
1,Darjeeling Tasting Notes? 
1,"Are my yixing pots moldy? I live in a pretty dry area (Northern Midwest) and tend to stretch my steepings over two or sometimes three or four days, in which i leave the pot with the wet leaves inside overnight (covered). I found this to be the best way to extend my sessions, as if I remove the leaves or leave the pot uncovered the leaves dry out and they do not taste good. I have never felt my tea to taste moldy or bad, nor do my pots smell like mold, but I have noticed these dark areas on the insides of my pots. at first I assumed it to be just staining where the leaves would accumulate, as I tend to drink red teas, pu'er and high roast / aged yancha / taiwan oolong. Should I be worried that this is mold? I have been drinking out of these pots regularily for over a year now, and got them brand new. The hongni and duanni pots seem to have more dark spots than the zini. Any advice or opinions welcome!

I recently purchased some weed (pure sunfarms pure sun CBD) and the scent realllyyy reminds me of some sort of tea I've had in the past..almost rose? like but floral? I'm smelling it right now and its like the second rear half of the initial scent..

I've looked up the strain and here are some of the compounds inside the weed: Myrcene, Linalool, Caryophyllene, Bisabolol, Guaiol. 

Does anyone know if any of these compounds are responsible for a floral rose ish like scent? I also realize that there probably isn't any shortage of generally floral oolongs out there so I'm happy to take recommendations. 

Thank you!!"

1,"Geography of Chinese Tea (book review) Review of a good tea reference text, the Geography of Chinese Tea.  It covers a lot of tea areas, not just the more familiar ones, including details on many tea types, processing steps, plant types, geography, and history, with just a bit included for traditional legends.  It's based on many years of research and experience of visiting those places by the author, Sergey Shevelev, the founder of Moychay.  A lot of people pass on interesting stories and experiences based on visiting China a limited number of times, from talking to local producers and vendors, and this represents a much expanded version of that.  The content was collected over a decade, per the author, probably with added in-depth research based on access to a range of Chinese language information sources.

Tea books aren't for everyone, and this isn't set up to help you brew tea, all abstract background instead.  I did mention links to a few online video sources for basic information in this post, including Sergey's channel, Farmerleaf's, Tea DB (a blog), and Tea House Ghost's (kind of vendor channel and reference source).  Mei Leaf isn't so bad (which I didn't mention), but to me it's annoying watching sales oriented content, and their videos are 80-90% generally good background and 10-20% geared towards selling that product, as I see it.  It's not hard to filter that part back out but I'd just as soon not, and their content is more general than I can still learn from.

I had a ""traditional"" strip-twisted Tie Guan Yin the other day and it was phenomenol--aromas like a Dancong on the nose, and thick mouthfeel with proper TGY flavors on the palette. I was wondering when Anxi producers switched from a nongxiang, strip style Oolong to the qingxiang ball style. I have read conflicting accounts--some say that the switch happened as recently as the 1980s and 90s due to the influence of Taiwanese tea makers. Others say that the switch happened decades earlier and that Anxi tea makers held influence over the Taiwanese in their development of gaoshan green ball Oolongs.

So, TLDR, we drank a wine that tasted UNCANNILY like one of Teavanna's old blends. Anyone else every have this experience, or remember what the Youthberry blend really tasted like? And do the teavanna Youthberry sachets they sell now actually taste anything like the old blend?

I would say the wine tasted a bit like hibiscus and apple with, obviously, orange flavor from the orange. But we are also complete wine noobs. All I know is that I had tasted the same flavor before..... and it was a tea !!!"

I ran across a chai mix (not instant, but a pre-made mix with real spices/tea) that I fell in love with. But it's fairly pricey (I'm sure it's fair for what it is but we're on a budget). :)

The ingredients are simple and few. They are (in order listed):
Tea (they have two options one with black tea, the other with rooibos)
Cinnamon  
Cardamom  
Ginger  
Black Pepper  
Cloves  

They even offer the spice mix without the tea. But I can get the ingredients, even organic, etc for a fraction of the price mixed. The company says that the guy who created this recipe did so from having traveled all around India and used their traditional ingredients and recipes.  
  
I've never tried to recreate a recipe before and I'm having trouble finding a recipe with just these ingredients online. Does anyone know a) of a recipe that has the ingredients in it that I might start from or b) where would you start trying to recreate it yourself? I know ingredients are generally in the order of most to least in their listing but that's about all I know.

1,"How long did it take you to get used to real matcha? For several years I've really enjoyed the ""matcha"" flavor in drinks with lots of added dairy and/or sugar (lattes, boba, etc.) and sweets (mochi, ice cream, cakes, etc.). I wanted to try drinking traditional matcha, not only for the flavor but also for the many health benefits and sustained energy it offers. When trying the real thing, however, I found the flavor to be quite jarring.

I'm sure it's because I am used to the matcha flavor being present with a slew of other additives, but it just tastes wrong. I know it is supposed to have ""umami"" but it tastes *extremely* earthy, chalky, and rather bitter. I taste the distinct matcha flavor somewhat but can't pick up any of the sweetness or butteriness it's supposed to have. I've read that the flavor of pure matcha is an acquired taste, so I am wondering if I should expect to get used to it if I just keep drinking it daily.

I am almost certain I am doing everything right: I make sure the water is exactly 176 degrees F, I sift the powder, whisk with a chasen, and use a proper water-to-tea ratio (60mL/1 tsp). I'm also using a high-quality brand (Ippodo). When I finish preparing the matcha it looks exactly how (I think) it's supposed to, with a beautiful pastel-green froth above a dark green liquid."

1,"Tea-making process and gluten? Hello tea-friends 

I have a question about how tea leaves are made, specifically green teas and pu-ers. In general, I like knowing the in depth process of how things are made! I have seen those handy charts showing the differences between oolongs, green tea, black tea, etc. But they do not go super in depth about the process. I'm specifically wondering about how gluten makes it way into teas.

I'd like to add some context to my question, so that you can understand the full depth here. Disclaimer, I will talk about some medical things, but I am in no way asking for medical advice, I'm just providing some context for my question. 

I have celiac disease, and as a result I cannot eat anything that contains or is cross contaminated with gluten (found in wheat, barley, rye). For obvious reasons, I do not drink barley tea, however, what really surprised me is that green tea has been found to have trace amount of gluten in it. My doctor has been following a scientist that randomly tests products for gluten and their green tea testing has repeatedly come back with trace amounts of gluten. I have also found that I have reactions to pu-er tea, (I have put both teas on my ""do not eat/drink"" list)

Now I know that tea-leaves should not have any gluten in it. However, I'll go on a side tangent to tell another story. I also have an egg allergy. I would drink wine occasionally, and always have some kind of reaction. For awhile I could not figure out why, was I allergic to wine as well even though I could eat grapes? Then I found out that many wine makers will either use fish bladders or eggs whites to strain their wines. It's something that is not widely talked about but I was grateful to learn. So this made me very curious about teas and gluten. I always thought that it was due to a shared facility with gluten but maybe it's coming from somewhere else? Where in the process could this be happening?

Again, full disclaimer I am not asking for medical advice. Even though I cannot drink green or pu-er tea, that won't stop me from learning all about it! Do you have any favorite tea-making sources or knowledge that could help me understand the tea leaf-making process better? Or where do you think this trace amount of gluten could be coming from? 

Mods, if this post is too close to medical talk, I'll understand if it's removed and I'll keep searching elsewhere."

1,"What's in my teabag? Here are all the producers that Lipton and PG Tips buy from. In 2019-09, Unilever (which owned Lipton, PG Tips, T2, Tazo, Pure Leaf, and more) published a list of its tea suppliers:  was known for purchasing roughly 10% of the world's tea supply. Their list of 1261 producers was last updated in 2020-09, and the data are summarized in this chart:  dominated by India at 1008 producers (80%), followed by Bangladesh at 60 (5%) and Sri Lanka at 53 (4%).

In 2021-11, Unilever sold its tea business (under the name ""ekaterra"") to CVC:  sale excluded parts of Unilever's tea business in India, Indonesia, and Nepal where sales were good. So ekaterra buys 5% of the world's tea supply, but it is nevertheless the largest tea company in the world at this time. Their list of 287 producers was last updated in 2020:  are the data**:  60 producers in Bangladesh now represent 21% of ekaterra's portofolio, and the 53 in Sri Lanka constitute 18%. ekaterra got a little bit from India: 43 producers (15%). It also received the 32 producers in Kenya (11%) and the 29 in China (10%).

****

So what does this mean for you? Well, it's hard to say. These producers are used to supply the tea sold by Lipton, PG Tips, etc. Different brands may be affected differently. But in general, we might expect these teabags to become more variable and carry less assam character.

Going forward, ekaterra will likely focus less on black tea (a slow-growing market, which is why Unilever divested from this business) and more on herbals and green tea.

Also note that these are the number of producers in each country -- not the amount of tea from each country. ekaterra likely gets more tea from each producer in Kenya (where it owns many of the plantations) than it does from each producer in, say, China. It's hard to say what's in any given teabag, but this gives us some idea of it."

I've been drinking matcha for 9 years, and I've noticed every time I take breaks from it with Bai Mu Dan (white) or blacks I always feel trembly and panicky after drinking, as if I'm going to have a panic attack. After drinking it, my hands tremble. What's odd is that, even with coffee, I don't feel as panicky as with white or black tea, although it gives a different kind of discomfort.

Since it shouldn't be the caffeine, since I get much more of it from matcha and coffee -- does anyone know if white and black teas are especially high in any compound that can increase anxiety? Obviously, matcha has a lot of theanine, but so does Bai Mu Dan... and coffee has none, so it shouldn't be that either. With matcha, I feel literally no anxiety whatsoever even after hefty dosages.

Anyone had the same experience?"
1,"""Jin Jun Mei"" a campaign, not a tea? So, if you've been around the broader world of tea, its lore, its history, geography, cultus, mystic secrets, intrigue, subterfuge, and Glory, you know that there are many rabbit holes, some distressing, and many famous 'stings' and scams.  This is a saga of being ""taken in"" by what I thought was merely an interesting tea Type that I wanted to know, or try.

First, I have good respect for Scott and the team at Yunnansourcing and until I find an unquestionably better vendor, I'm sticking with them - they get 90% of my business.  Awhile back, in order to try more of the top-rated Black/Red teas at YS, as I typically would I looked at only teas that had more than a few ratings, and high ratings \[the tendency of all of us is to not be mean/nasty in ratings/reviews even when warranted\].  I saw/read every word of review of two different versions of something new-to-me, Jin Jun Mei.  I assumed casually that ""everybody knows this Type"" or style except me - 'wrong!'. But the reviews of the ""Classic Robust Jin Jun Mei Black of Fujian"" were favorable and interesting, so I jumped on 100G to find out.  It was/is VERY good black tea for my taste buds and was tummy friendly, which is something I watch carefully and mark in my notes.  Good.  So later after chatting on Discord with a couple of other people about JJM's from another vendor or two \[neither seemed to have a lot of 'buzz' in the community\], I decided to have a competition to see if any of the other JJM could beat the first one I tried.  I bought all but one, I think, of YS's offerings, which are varied, in small amounts: 25 and 50G, Plus a rebuy of the original ""Classic Robust"" in larger amount.  All four of the other ones were a ""bust"":  ""Competition Grade"", ""Pure Gold"", ""Imperial Grade"", ""Premium Grade AA"".  Three of them were just lousy to my 30-tea-years-experience tastes, including the most expensive of the bunch \[good marketing.... typically people that 'buy up' will defend their own integrity by saying nice things about their decision\].  

So I went looking for answers because my ""antennae were twitching"".  If you are one of the rare people that knows how to read VERY CAREFULLY Wikipedia pages, look very closely at the structure here, the 'folks' involved, notes, etc:  [Wiki-typical for Jin Jun Mei]( Next read this one: [Wiki2 JJM]( at dates, and every word - get the feel....

Then take a look at this:  [TeaGuardian's take on JJM]( have to chuckle looking back on it all. There are lots of other articles and salesmanship on ""JJM"", but that's enough.  Oh, I forgot to say I also tried one from [  It was no worse than the others, above... I gave it to my grandson who is just barely walking on tea water

YMMV!

And LET ME REPEAT:  Whatever the real name is or should be of the variety/type that YS sells under the banner ""Classic Robust Jin Jun Mei"" - it is a WIN, and I really enjoy it \[Thanks Scott!\].  It has sympathy with their ""Tu Cha"" enigmatic and frustrating black, their ""Sweet Potatoe"", in being rich, dark, strong if you allow it, aromatic, 'wet', not bitter if you don't push it, and generous. It is the best so-called JJM of the .. is it 5 or 6 I tried, BY FAR and I am DONE with them.

I'd be happy to work a trade if anyone want to try out several of these"

I've been experimenting with a bag of somewhat ok quality Asamushi Sencha on different temps and different infusion times, and both tried to drink the infusions separately and tried mixing them.

1,"Coming from specialty coffee, wondering if there are any blogs with a bit more scientific approach to brewing tea Hi! I'm quite new to good tea, but I'm quite used to good coffee. As far as I see it, there are a lot of similarities between specialty coffee and good tea. As far as I understand, traceability, freshness, and a deeper understanding of the thing you soak in water are important for both coffee folks and tea folks.

The main difference though (as I see it) is that there are quite a lot of coffee bloggers/influencers/persons exercising a more scientific approach to coffee brewing, using refractometers to read the extraction yields in the cup, trying to understand the underlying physics behind a tasty cup of coffee, weighing the coffee and the water on 0.1-gram scales and hating the coffee scoops since you can't estimate the weight of coffee with it, etc.

On the other side, I don't see much of this in tea. I see a lot of recipes using teaspoons to measure the amount of tea, I see influencers that say that you should use feeling to determine the right temperatures and stuff, I see people saying that different teaware produces different tea (which of course might be true, but why not use the glass teaware to make sure it doesn't affect your tea?). I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's quite a new thing to me.

First of all, I'm wondering if some of you feel the same way?

Second of all, do you know any tea persons with blogs/books/youtube channels, who exercise a more scientific approach to brewing tea, and not only say that ""X affects Y"", but more like ""X affects Y because of Z and yes there was a recent paper on this""?"

I absolutely *adore* tea and all of its flavours and the ceremony and the calmness brewing it brings and all that kind of stuff, but I also have a pretty low tolerance for caffeine - drinking much more than about 350ml of tea in a sitting starts to make me feel pretty unpleasant. I've tried gongfu-style brewing and love the idea of it, but when you drink tea alone 95% of the time, getting your money's worth out of the five or six grams of tea it takes means you have to drink a lot of steepings, and the caffeine in all of that adds up pretty quickly. So I've been trying to find ways to get a gongfu-like experience with less caffeine consumption without feeling too much like I'm wasting good tea leaves.

My first thought was to just do sort of 'Western-style brewing in a gaiwan' - i.e. less tea for longer, just using the really nice teaware I already have - and so I put two grams into a hundred-ish millilitre gaiwan and did it for about two minutes. After a while, though, I realised that this was actually way oversteeping the tea, and so I tried to experiment a bit more; what I'm starting to settle on seems to be something that's inbetween gongfu-style ~5g/~100ml/;10s steep times and Western-style ~2g/~300ml/;=2m steep times. Two grams of tea in a ~100ml gaiwan seems to work well in the 30s - 1m range (though this morning 30s seemed a bit much for the red tea bing I was using), and I can get three good steepings for my use of two grams before I have to stop for caffeine reasons. 

(Just to try and get a bit more value out of the leaves before throwing them out, I usually cold brew the used leaves and drink that the next morning. It's not super great with teas that really need hot water to get the flavour out, but it's still something.)

I'm curious if anyone's tried something like this before (it's probably not as original as I think it is!), and if anyone's got suggestions for how to improve on the idea."
1,"Looking for a *tiny* gaiwan I'm looking to find a *very small* gaiwan for solo gongfu sessions as someone with a relatively low caffeine tolerance. (I would just search the internet, but it's remarkably difficult to find this *particular* thing, apparently.) I've found like one 60ml option I can get in the US, but I was wondering if anyone knows of other good sources, especially for even smaller ones - I could happily do 40ml if such a thing exists."

There's some similar teas online to the Blueberry Bliss or Pineapple but I'm not sure if there's a particular place or shop I should purchase them from.

1,"I think I fell in love with the art of tea. Hello, guys. I wanted to say that I'm new to the world of tea. I never was really into it, but you know, given recent events, I wanted to go more natural when it comes to a morning drink or just to unwind in general. after recently finding myself and thinking about what really made me happy, and one thing that popped into my mind was a cup of tea that I had. It was the only properly brewed one I've had in my life, and, followed with amazing conversation, I felt so content.

So I went into search mode and I learned how to make a proper cup of tea. Fast forward to tonight, and after investing in a special mug and a kettle, I brewed my first cup of Lady Grey tea, and, when it hit my tongue, I cried for 2 reasons.

Reason 1: **I burned my f\*\*king tongue.** 

Reason 2: The flavors were so delicious, and I could instantly pick apart the citrus notes apart and just... The experience with the taste reminded me of my first time. I almost cried because there's comfort in a cup. And it makes me so happy."

I see plenty of 4/5 stars but then all of the 1 stars have some serious consistent defect or are straight up saying they received a different product. I have no idea what to believe. Does anyone have a kettle that they can for sure say doesn’t leak and lasts more than 6 months? Also I’m in the market for a gooseneck if I can help it.

1,"Why did you start drinking tea? This is mostly an appreciation post, but man I love tea, but it wasn't always like that. I used to be a big coffee drinker until I was in a really stressful time in life, and coffee started to give me panic attacks so I quit. I stopped drinking all caffeine for a while and just drank herbal tea, but then gradually started drinking actual tea and now I'm hooked. I always look forward to my gaiwan full of (usually) earl grey or genmaicha, and Taiwanese Gaba Oolongs when I can afford them ;) I love tea because it wakes me up but never makes me feel jittery... I still drink coffee but can only have it in moderation because I feel so hyped up and then crash. Tea is on one hand super comforting but also makes me feel calmly prepared for my day...much different feeling from coffee for me at least. 

So I'm curious, what made you all become tea drinkers? I'm interested to hear :)"
1,"What's your favourite English Breakfast and why? I'm about to start trading a little coffee van in London, and I've not settled on generic tea offering brands.

I've had some better ones than most people's everyday brews, but still not blown away by them. 

Without breaking the bank, my favourite was Taylor's harrogate premium line (black case) but its' kinda hard to get for retail - maybe I've not looked enough.

I've been looking into brew tea co and good and proper teas. Teapigs are alright (and very easy to get) but not very special, and I've had their EB and not too impressed. 

Any recommendations? 

;#x200B;

Also, an additional questions... What are the tea lover's opinion about teabags? I think the pyramids are okay and looks good enough... I have a tiny truck I don't think I can accomodate loose leaf tea with infuser strainers and deal with all of them... I've previously worked with clever type steep tea brewrs before but they take even more space. 

Thanks so much in advance."

1,"Tea tastes worse through new strainer? Call me crazy, but... 

For almost a year now, since I discovered my morning coffee was the reason my stomach had turned into a boiling acid pit, I've been drinking loose leaf tea every morning through a somewhat makeshift method: I poured water just off the boil over the leaves in a Pyrex measuring cup, let them steep 5-7 mins, then poured them through a mesh pasta strainer into a cup. It wasn't fancy, but I got a delicious cuppa every time. (For reference, I drink August Uncommon's ""Jet Black"" most mornings.)

Christmas rolls around, and my partner very kindly gets me a fine mesh tea strainer from Finum to simplify the process. The problem is, somehow, the tea doesn't taste as good through it. The bitterness comes through, but none of the sweet, caramel-y notes that I love from this tea. The first time I used it after Christmas I legitimately thought I was having c0vid loss-of-taste. 

I haven't changed anything about my process except for the strainer; I even tried adding a little more tea (normally I used a tablespoon) and the flavor was only marginally better. 

Can anyone explain to me why this might be and how I can fix it?! Please and thank you!!"

1,"Leaf age by tea type? Note: this post isn't about aged tea; it's about how long leaves are left on a plant before being harvested.

I read an article that mentioned in passing that the tea leaves used for black and oolong tea are older than those used for green tea. That is to say, green tea leaves are picked right away whereas black and oolong leaves are left on the plant longer.

Is this true at all? I'm having trouble finding other sources for this info. Aren't leaf buds very young? In which case a very tippy black tea (Dian Hong / Yunnan Gold as an extreme example) would have young leaves, right?

The oolong varieties I've tried have had *huge* leaves when compared to most of the full-leaf black teas I've had. Does that mean those are older leaves? Or would it just be that whatever cultivar is used for those oolongs has bigger leaves?"

1,"US tea brands? Hi, y'all. So I've recently started drinking hot tea (American southerner here, I've been doing sweet iced tea since I was young enough to also be breastfeeding). I'm loving it, but it took me a *long* time to get it to a point where I liked it. 

I typically use 24ish ounces (±700ml) of boiling water (got me an electric kettle, like civilized folk), and 2 twinings brand Irish Breakfast Tea tea bags, and I steep it for 20 minutes. 

I am aware this is significantly longer than is generally done. But it always tastes ""thin"" or watery if I do less than that. I'm doing college classes at home, and will make this in a big metal travel mug that keeps it hot for hours, and drink it all day. Normally 3ish cups a day or more. 

I'm also using powdered coffee creamer in it, which I'm pretty sure just made everyone in this sub go ""oof."" (If it helps, I make my own using freeze dried milk and spices)

I'd like to know if I need to steep it like this because I'm buying some really crap American weak tea, or if it's because I just have a taste for.much stronger tea than normal? I'd like to try some other brands, but don't know where to start.

1,"Newbie questions I'm very new to tea and trying to research online has left me with more questions than answers.

So here are a bunch of questions I have about buying tea:

As someone who really can't distinguish between a decent tea and a really good tea, should I stick to cheaper stuff right now? What price range would you recommend?

At what point does spending more money on tea give diminishing returns on quality?

Are samplers a good idea or should I pick out individual teas to try?

Are there any specific vendors/samplers/teas you would recommend for a beginner? (I've looked at the recommended vendors list and it's a bit overwhelming)

Would you recommend trying pu er tea as a beginner?

I also have a couple questions about brewing tea:

For the few personal gong fu sessions I've done I used about 2.5g leaves for about 50mL water. Is that enough leaves/does doing it that way defeat the purpose of gong fu?

How do you learn to pick up on different tasting notes? Does it just happen over time?

Is it easier to detect different flavors from nicer teas?

I recognize that a lot of these questions boil down to personal preference but I trust that you all know a lot more than I do"
